A 23-year old man, reportedly the main suspect in several alleged incidents of violation of graves at Tshitavha Village outside Thohoyandou recently, was arrested in George in the Western Cape on Saturday and is expected to appear in the Thohoyandou Magistrate&#8217;s Court tomorrow (Tuesday). Three other suspects in the matter are also presently being detained. Provincial Police Corporate Communications Head, Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that the man is presumed to being the main suspect in the matter and was apprehended after intense investigations by members of the task team appointed to investigate cases where a corpse without a head was exhumed as well as another grave opened where no corpse was found. The suspect sought by Police since the start of the investigations in which the first body was exhumed from a grave at Tshitavha recently, Mojapelo said, adding that the suspect might be linked to several cases of violation of graves and corpses in the area. A traditional healer, Erick Kwinda (39) was arrested last week in connection with the same case. He appeared in the Thohoyandou Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Friday and remains in custody while awaiting his next appearance on 30 October, according to Mojapelo. Two more suspects, aged 20 and 29, were also arrested late last week and are expected to appear in the same court today (Monday). Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com &nbsp;
