Learners at PEPPS Preparatory School were honoured and awarded for their hard work during the school s Academic, Culture and Sport Recognition ceremony held at the school s auditorium last Thursday. The awards were given to learners who excelled or who have improved significantly in academics, sport or culture during the second term. Headmistress Julia Werner said a certificate is not the finish line but a mere recognition of learners achievements on their path of learning. She further urged learners to continue working hard and participate in extramural activities. Grade 7 learner Aicha Mengouchi stole the limelight as she received a number of certificates for excelling in both academics and sport. She was the first on the top ten list for best performers in her grade, best overall in Mathematics with 92% and also received an award for outstanding performance at the Bosveld Kunstefees and for being the overall trophy winner at the same event after participating in ten items.
