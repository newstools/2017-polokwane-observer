F amily members of murder suspect Lolo Madonsela who allegedly killed his neighbour and drank her blood had to evacuate their homes in Zaaiplaas after community members went on a rampage and set alight their houses on Saturday. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said community members, January Thamane, Mike Mashegoane, Christable Manzini and Johan nes Mashifane were arrested on charges of arson and public violence and appeared in the Groblersdal Magistrate s Court on Monday. They were granted free bail and the case was postponed until the next day (Tuesday). The public violence emanated from an incident early last week when Madonsela was allegedly seen by a passer-by to be hacking his neighbour, Anna Mashifane (39) with a sharp object. The witness reportedly recalled seeing the suspect drinking the blood of the victim as well. According to Ngoepe the Police were informed and upon arrival on the scene found the suspect with an axe in his hands. Ngoepe further confirmed that counselling was arranged for the victim s children and community members who had witnessed the ordeal. On Saturday community members mobilised and allegedly burnt the houses of the murder suspect s parents. An eight room house, RDP house and a shack, together valued at R250 000, were set alight. Police were allered of the incident and arrested four suspects. Madonsela was expected to appear in the same court on Tuesday on a charge of murder. Police once more warned community members to refrain from taking the law into their own hands. Investigations continue. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
