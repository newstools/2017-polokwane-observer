The University of Limpopo s (UL) rugby team caused a major upset when they beat Goldwagen Noordelikes 27-14 on their home ground in a Boet Fick League match on Saturday. Tebele Letsoalo, Kgothatso Lesudi, Collen Langa and Gladwin Khoza converted for UL while Christo van der Merwe and Danie van Staden scored tries for Noordelikes. Noordelikes Coach, Shaun Van der Merwe described the match as hard and tough but played in good spirit. It was a hard match. Both teams are equal in strength but determination was the winner. We used our speed to get over the line and it worked, said UL Coach, Kobus Redelinghuys. UL s next match will be on 3 June when they host Pietersburg/ Dendron Rugby Club.
