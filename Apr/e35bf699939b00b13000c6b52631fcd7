Polokwane city centre came to a near standstill as Police embarked on Operation Back to Basics on Monday, following recent attacks on businesspersons in the area. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said Polokwa ne and Westenburg recently experienced an escalation in drug dealing which prompted the Polokwane Cluster to embark on the operation in the central business district, surrounding suburbs and industrial areas. Ironically, the operation aimed at drug related crimes yielded no success in this field. Ngoepe however said nine undocumented migrants were arrested, a spaza shop closed and the owner summoned under Section 33 to appear before an immigration officer to ascertain if he was registered with the South African Revenue Service. A further three summonses were issued to illegally operating motor mechanics, 20 vehicles were checked by the Police Vehicle Identification Unit, two were impounded for expired licenses and three summonses issued for road traffic ordinance. Two hundred and thirteen counterfeit CDs were confiscated and 90 people were stopped and searched. Ngoepe warned that similar operations will continue to be conducted unannounced and regularly in all crime infested areas in and around Polokwane. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
