Polokwane High Court brought relief to the Mankweng community after a life imprisonment term was imposed on two alleged serial rapists last Wednesday. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the accused, Isaiah Masenya (29) and Doctor Mogota (27) were allegedly terrorising the Mankweng community and were found guilty of various crimes. It is alleged that the duo committed robbery, rape, attempted murder and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Ngoepe said the accused were sentenced for 15 years on charges of robbery, life imprisonment on rape and seven years sentence on cases of attempted murder. Masenya was handed an additional life imprisonment for a charge of rape, eight years sentence for rape of a minor and three years for attempting to commit a sexual offence. Ngoepe said In February 2007 Masenya and his accomplice met three women who were heading home at about 19:30. The duo robbed and repeatedly raped two women in Ga-Mothiba Village at knifepoint. Afterwards, they attempted to murder a 25-year-old woman who was a sister to one of the two victims and left her for dead in the mountain. He further said that in January 2008, while in Polokwane Police custody for house breaking, Masenya allegedly raped a 25-year-old man in the Police cells while in June 2008, at 19:00, Masenya raped a 15-year-old girl in the field in Makotopong Village. The serial rapist was positively identified through DNA. On another charge, Masenya allegedly attempted to commit a sexual offence with a 19-year-old woman who knew him. Masenya was reportedly involved in more than 19 cases against him including escaping from police custody. Story: ENDY SENYATSI &gt;&gt;endy@observer.co.za
