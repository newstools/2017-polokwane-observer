While households across the city were ready to settle for the night, Limpopo Knights brought the Protea Hotel Ranch Resort golf course to life when they hosted the Limpopo Knight Golf charity event on Friday. Eleven teams equalling 44 players set out in the dark, armed with a club or two, glow sticks fastened to strategic parts of their bodies and a glowing golf ball. Players battled it out on the 12 holes but it was Johan Kelder who walked away with the first prize, followed by Nico Myburgh who left the overall third position to Gert Jooste. Myburgh also claimed nearest to the pin on the second hole while Jooste followed in his footsteps on the sixth. Liano Villiers and Clive Silva also landed their balls nearest to the pin on the eighth and tenth hole respectively. Silva was fortunate to hit a hole in one on the fourth hole. Limpopo Knight Nelmar Smit said the aim was to raise funds for the organisation s future projects.
