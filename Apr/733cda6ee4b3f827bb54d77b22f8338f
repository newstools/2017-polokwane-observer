Professional and amateur cycling enthusiasts can look forward to Polokwane Municipality s fourth annual Mayoral Cycle Race that is scheduled to start at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium at 07:00 on 28 May. Distances covered will be 15 km, 45 km and 96 km and the race is a category A event that places it in the same class as the Cape Argus. The proceeds of the event will go towards the Executive Mayor s bursary fund and donations to NGOs. The municipality raised R200 000 last year from registration fees of 2 000 entrants and aims to push it up to 2 500 this year, acting Municipal Manager Ndavhe Ramakuela earlier said. On-line registrations for the race are already open and can be done on www.polokwanecyclerace.co.za.
