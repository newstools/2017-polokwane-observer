The Police made their point clear that criminal behaviour will no longer be tolerated as they embarked on Operation Bontsha Mohlala or Lead by example in the Makhado and Groblersdal Clusters respectively on Saturday. The operation was conducted under command of Deputy Provincial Commissioner Jan Scheepers and involved officers from all stations within the clusters as well as members ranked from captain to major-general attached to the provincial office. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the main objective of the operation was to hit hard on criminals but also to lead by example for lower rankings officers. The operation focussed on problematic crimes such as property related and contact crimes. Several houses were raided, roadblocks established and stop and search procedures conducted in certain crime infested areas, according to Ngoepe. He added that 39 suspects were arrested for various offences such as possession of dagga (12), illegal gambling (1), assault and malicious damage to property (1), drinking in public (14) and drunken driving (1). Seven illegal migrants were also arrested, 222 vehicles stopped and searched, 965 individuals searched, four houses raided and searched and several vehicles and individuals details circulated. The arrestees will appear before various courts in the two clusters respectively. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com Police searching a vehicle stopped at a roadblock.
