Police established a task team to investigate the increase of crime targeting off-campus students from the University of Limpopo (UL). Seven students were robbed of their personal belongings over the past weekend alone. Provincial Police Corporate Communications Head, Motlafela Mojapelo indicated that several house robberies had been reported by off-campus students within Mankweng. During the weekend four laptops, seven cell phones and R500 in cash were stolen from students. Earlier this year, two suspects were nabbed during a crime intelligence-led operation in Mankweng and firearms as well as stolen property recovered. This was followed by the arrest of another suspect found in possession of suspected stolen property such as laptops and cell phones, Mojapelo said. On 13 April a suspect who had been found guilty of terrorising UL students in 2012 was given a life sentence combined with 20 years for each of three counts of rape plus five years on another count of armed robbery. The spate of robberies is on the high priority list of the task team which consists of members of the Crime Intelligence Unit and Mankweng Detectives Unit.
