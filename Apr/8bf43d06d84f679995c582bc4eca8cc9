Magesi Football Club, will be hoping to win their match against the seventh placed Amazulu Football Club when the two clash at Princes Magogo Stadium in KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday. The Moletjie based team has never had joy in the National First Division (NFD) since their promotion from the ABC Motsepe League last year August. Of their last 22 matches they won three, drew nine and lost ten, a worrying reality for their supporters as they find themselves rooted in the 15th position of the division and are in desperate need of points in order to keep their NFD status. Chief Executive Officer of the Club, John Mathibe promised fans that they won t go back to the Motsepe ABC League. We are left with eight matches and we have planned very well for them. We understand the division now and I think we will get better in every game. We promise our fans that we won t be relegated we will continue fighting for points, Mathibe said. He also mentioned that they are concerned about Amazulu who have experienced and former Bafana Bafana players in their squad. We beat in the 2-1 in the first round of the division and I am confident we can beat them again. We know they have Mabhuti Khenyeza and Siyabonga Nomvethe who have played for Bafana Bafana before but we have studied them very well. We know their strengths and weaknesses and there is nothing to worry about, Mathibe said. Story and photo: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za &nbsp;
