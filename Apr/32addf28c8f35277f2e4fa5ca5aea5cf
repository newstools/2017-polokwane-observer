A tip-off from community members and quick response from the Police led to the arrest of six suspects apparently planning to rob a liquor outlet in the Central Business District of Polokwane on Monday. When we received the information a task team was immediately established from members of various Police units. We reacted swiftly and successfully intercepted a group of six armed suspects aged between 23 and 35 using two vehicles and who were allegedly on their way to rob a liquor outlet, Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said. During the arrest Police recovered three 9 mm pistols and four pairs of gloves and also confiscated a Nissan X-Trail. The origin of the firearms and vehicle is still being investigated. Ngoepe could not confirm whether the suspects had appeared in the Polokwane Magistrate s Court yet. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
