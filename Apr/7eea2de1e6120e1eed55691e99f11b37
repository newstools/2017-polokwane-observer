Murder accused Rameez Patel was expected to testify in the Limpopo High Court yesterday (Wednesday) after an application by the state to have his bail cancelled was brought before court last week but Judge President Ephraim Makgoba immediately postponed the case to July for trial. The case was placed on the roll from 10 to 21 July. Makgoba emphasised the importance that the case be finalised then and extended Patel s bail. Judge Joseph Raulinga last week ruled that Patel be restricted within the borders of Limpopo and not allowed to visit any port of entry or exit of South Africa or be seen within a 5 km radius thereof with the exception of Polokwane International Airport as he conducts business close to the airport. His three children s passports also had to be returned to the investigating officer. This after the state called the investigating officer Richard Moshomane to the witness stand last week who testified that Patel phoned him on 9 March asking to have his passport returned as he needed as a favour as he needed to travel abroad to attend to estate matters of his late father. It was also mentioned that Patel was reportedly seen at OR Tambo International Airport in March which caused concern with the state who brought an application before court to cancel his bail for fear that he would abscond. Raulinga questioned the vagueness of evidence by Mosho mane because no clarity could be given as to when exactly Patel was seen at OR Tambo International Airport and what his intentions were. Patel is standing trial for the murder of his wife, Fatima who was found dead in the couples home in Nirvana two years ago. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
