Police confirmed on Monday that a 26-year-old woman was raped in the veld adjacent to Logan Street in Eduan Park by an unknown man last Thursday afternoon. Polokwane Police Spokesperson Lesiba Ramoshaba said the woman was allegedly assaulted and then raped. She managed to escape and ran to a street where she flagged down a vehicle. The Police were informed and a case of rape was opened. We are following up information but no arrest has been made yet, Ramoshaba said. In a second incident a woman was robbed of her purse in the park opposite Ho r Tegniese Skool Tom Naud at around 14:30 on Saturday. According to the victim she had just finished work when she was approached by two men who demanded her purse which she handed over to avoid confrontation with the thugs. When they allegedly took her purse she asked to at least have her prepaid electricity card but the muggers refused. They demanded the PIN-number for her bank card but she provided an incorrect number. After they had left in the direction of Magazyn Street the woman rushed to a local taxi rank where another woman assisted her to cancel her bank card. In the meantime, an alleged serial rapist was expected to appear in the Mankweng Magistrate s Court as well as the Sekgosese Magistrate s Court on Monday after being arrested by Police in Mankweng on the weekend. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the suspect might be linked to at least eight rape cases in Mankweng, Sebayeng and Morebeng. He allegedly targeted women aged between 19 and 43 from the respective areas embarking on his modus operandi since November 2008 to January 2015, Ngoepe said but could not confirm if the suspects did appear in court. Investigations continue. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
