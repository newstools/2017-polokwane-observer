Polokwane s top athletes and members of Pietersburg Road Runners (PRR) once again did the city and province proud by achieving top results and finishing third overall in the men s team race at the Old Mutual Two Oceans Ultra Marathon hosted in Cape Town on Saturday. According to the team manager, Johan van der Merwe they expected at least two gold medals and a team win. Though we are disappointed we remain proud of the team s overall third place. It was a tough race characterised by strong winds. Our achievement is also unique as the Two Oceans was a first for two of our athletes, Van der Merwe said. He said the winning teams are determined by the combined times of the club s first four finishers. Bethuel Netshifhefhe finished 20th overall in a time of 3:26.46 followed by Lutendo Mapoto 24th in a time of 3:28.08, Peter Muthubi 33rd and Timothy Munzhelele 34th respectively. Their combined time of 13:59.36 secured them the overall third place. Another PRR athlete Calvin Malatjie obtained an overall 48th place. Considering the magnitude of international athletes lured by the Two Oceans and the number of elite clubs competing, we can be very proud of the five athletes competing as amateurs. There is no need for them to stand back to any professional athlete, Van der Merwe said.
