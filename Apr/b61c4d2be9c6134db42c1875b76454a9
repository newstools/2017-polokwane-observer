Polokwane City Football Club Chief Operations Officer Tincy Tema has urged his players to forget the 1-0 defeat they suffered against Bloemfon tein Celtic Football Club last Sunday and urgently channel their energies into the remaining eight matches of the Premier Soccer League (PSL). The club is currently in seventh position on the log with 27 points and will have to win all their remaining matches to ensure that they finish the 2016/17 PSL season in the top eight bracket. We don t want to lose that spot. We have worked very hard this season and it will not be good for us if we don t finish what we started. Our goal was and remains to finish the season in the top eight bracket, Tema said. He also commented that their match against Celtic was always going to be tricky given Celtic s position in the league. Celtic came in to the match in 13th position and their feat against City saw them moving up one position in the league. They were in the relegation zone and it was always going to be a tricky encounter. We played very well, we had lot of chances, especially in the first half, but we were unable to convert them. However, we are happy with our technical team and players. We were just unlucky on the day, Tema said. Their next match is against Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Tuesday. In the first round of the league, City got one over Chippa and Tema is adamant that they can do a double over them. We beat them 1-0 last year and we are certain we can beat them again. We can t afford to lose matches especially at this time of the season, we need points, Tema said.
