With only eight matches left before the 2016/17 National First Division (NFD) season comes to an end, there is confidence in the camp that the team will be returning to the Premier Soccer League (PSL) next season. Lidoda Duvha was relegated to the National Football Division (NFD) four years ago and currently lies second on the log with 37 points after 22 matches and eight points behind log leaders, Thanda Zulu Royals. Club Spokesperson Benny Ramuneyiwa said they don t want to contest their PSL status in the division s promotional playoffs but be automatically promoted. We don t want to take the playoffs route. We have walked that route before and it was not a pleasant one. We are left with eight matches which is equivalent to 24 points and it is attainable, he said. We are playing very well at the moment. We managed to assemble a strong technical team which is something we have been yearning for in previous seasons. We have a coach that has brought stability in the team. He has won more games since starting with the team in November and we are happy with him and team s overall performance, Ramunenyiwa added. Their next match is against 10th placed Real King Football Club at Thohoyandou Stadium on 15 April. Ramunenyiwa stressed that preparations for the match are already well underway. It is not going to be an easy match. When you are on top every team wants to win against you and they are no different. We are again calling all supporters in the province to come to the stadium in droves and rally behind the team. We need their support and prayers, concluded Ramunenyiwa.
