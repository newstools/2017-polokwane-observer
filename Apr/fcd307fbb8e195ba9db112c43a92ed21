Cycling enthusiasts with a heart for children will have the opportunity to practise their sport in aid of a charitable cause on Sunday. A group of local businessmen and cycling enthusiasts are planning a charity event in which they aim to provide 92 children from Ga-Phago Village in Moletjie with among others, basic food items and blankets on 9 April. Coordinator of the event and fuel station owner in Bochum, Shaun Ramatlhodi invited cyclists to join in the event. It is not only for a good cause but cyclists will have the opportunity to do what they love most by cycling from Polokwane to Moletjie. We have already collected food, blankets, clothes and sanitary items which will be donated to children aged from 4 to 15, Ramatlhodi said. He added that the route entails a 57 km ride plus 6 km of gravel road to the village. It is important to note that it will be a one-way ride only. The group will gather at Cycle Concepts in Bendor shopping complex from 06:45 and leave no later than 07:00. Those interested in donating more items or just to enjoy the ride can contact Ramatlhodi on 083 256 1660. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com &nbsp;
