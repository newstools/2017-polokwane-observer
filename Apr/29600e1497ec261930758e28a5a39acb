Learners of Ho r Tegniese Skool Tom Naud honoured National Day of Prayer on Saturday by dedicating time for prayer before the onset of their winter sport meeting. Head girl Ronay Delport led the learners in prayer in support of the It s Time initiative by evangelist Angus Buchan. The initiative, a mass prayer gathering, took place on a farm in the Bloemfontein area on Saturday. We held a kneel-down before the matches started. It was essential and we aimed to be part of the people praying at congregations in the city and outside Bloemfontein where we couldn t attend because of our commitment at school, Ronay said. She said during the prayer they took the opportunity and thanked God for His goodness and grace. With our prayers we wanted to urge people to turn to God for everything that is happening to them and our fellow learners to stand up for God and worship Him all the time, she said.
