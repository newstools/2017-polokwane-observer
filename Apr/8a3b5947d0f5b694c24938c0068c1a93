Saturday morning provided an opportunity for motor cycle enthusiasts, young and old, to show off their skills around the track at the Capricorn Moto X Club s fun day that was hosted at the Moto X and Motorad tracks on the Silicon Road. According to Dean Rudiger, Chairperson of Capricorn Moto X Club, the purpose of the event was to create awareness and to introduce the public to the activities of the club and by doing so, to recruit new members. We currently have about 50 active members of which some are under ten years old. This is really a family sport and all you need to participate, is an off-road bike. The event was not a competition, just a day for all to have fun. We also raised some funds to help with the running of the club, Rudiger explained.
