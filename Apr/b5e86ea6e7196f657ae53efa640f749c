Is was expected that Judge Joseph Raulinga would make a decision whether the trial should be postponed after Patel s attorney, Tumi Mokoena reportedly asked for a postponement of the trial because of Patel s emotional state. He was reportedly stressed and not well during proceedings on Tuesday. It is reported that Mokoena mentioned in court that his client could not concentrate and had broken down during consultations and that he therefore needed to be mentally evaluated.
