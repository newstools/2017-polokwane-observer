Karatekas from as far as Pretoria and Zimbabwe were part of the annual Limpopo Shukokai Karate Championships that took place at the Polokwane Wrestling Club on Saturday. The championships catered for fighters from as young as six years. Zimbabwe was represented by three teams with one of them losing a trophy to Team Limpopo. Tournament organiser, Sensei Marcia van Niekerk explained that 115 participants competed in kata and kumite with medals at stake for the winners although the tournament was not about prizes but fun and establishing friendships. Van Niekerk further said it was a very strong competition and she was pleased with the turnout she thanked everyone who made the tourney a success. The sport of karate is all about defence and attack and all the participants proved that they really pay attention at their respective training sessions and revealed best karate moves. We had team fights with each team consisting of four boys and a lady and team Limpopo won the trophy, she said and added that the championships were all about good spirit and sportsmanship. She further urged all karatekas to continue working hard and have discipline and respect in order to make it far in the sport.
