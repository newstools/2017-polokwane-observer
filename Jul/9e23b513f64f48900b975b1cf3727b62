Last Thursday was a day to remember for 10 Grade 10 to 12 female learners of St Bede s High School in Ga-Molepo when they were hosted by Limpopo Gambling Board (LGB) as part of the annual Take a Girl Child to Work initiative. The girls shadowed staff members of the board as they went about their daily office tasks. Excitement ran high in the office of LGB Chief Executive Officer Serobi Maja when the girls were allowed to answer the telephone and assist with minor tasks. They were not allowed to sign cheques though, Maja jokingly said. The visitors were taken on a tour of the LGB offices and were introduced to staff members and managers that explained what the duties and activities of every business unit were. The girls, accompanied by educators from the school, were taken to lunch in the city and received gift bags containing stationery, coffee mugs, refreshments and a wall clock as well as certificates to remind them of this once in a lifetime experience. Grade 11 learner Nthabiseng Raseona said that she thoroughly enjoyed the visit. It was so informative and I am now really looking forward to a career as a working person. It was an amazing experience and so motivational. The staff members are so professional, Nthabiseng said.
