During an operation conducted last week until Monday a total of 201 suspects between the ages of 19 and 49 were arrested on charg es varying from house breaking, robbery, hijacking, business robbery, possession of firearms without licence and possession of drugs. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said 15 stolen vehicles with an estimated total worth of R3,5 million were recovered. Eight illegal firearms, a rifle with ammunition, 23 stolen cell phones, six laptops, three computers, clothing, drugs and groceries were also confiscated. Several bags of drugs were also confiscated. In Musina alone Police recovered a Toyota Fortuner stolen in Kuilsrivier and burnt to ashes, a Ford Ranger stolen in Vereeniging, Toyota Hilux stolen in Douglas and an Isuzu stolen at Kruistenhof, according to Ngoepe. During the operation Police arrested a 45-year-old man for possession of stolen copper cable worth R300 000 at Ditwebeleng village outside Burgersfort on the weekend. Police also arrested eight suspects and recovered a stolen Toyota Corolla, six sachets of drugs, two cell phones and a laptop in Bela-Bela. Provincial Police Commissioner Nneke Ledwaba has commended the members in blue from different Police units and stations for the success they have achieved during the operation. Serious incidents such as house robberies, hijackings and business robberies are still to be dealt with mercilessly and without compromise until all our communities are safe. We will leave no stone unturned during investigations to bring criminals to book, Ledwaba was quoted saying. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com Photos: Supplied
