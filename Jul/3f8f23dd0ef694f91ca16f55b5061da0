Agriculture and Rural Development MEC Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana engaged the South African Liberation of Independent Training and Intelligence Growth (Salitig) Training College management to start looking into creating a curriculum on basic agricultural skills to empower and equip aspiring farmers with necessary skills. She was speaking during the college s graduation ceremony held at the Jack Botes Hall on Saturday when graduates received their training certificates in various fields that range from Public Administration, Early Childhood Development to Computer Literacy. The college also presented awards in recognition of community builders and survivors of societal challenges such as domestic abuse among others. Among the recipients was 103-years-old Nora Ntsie from Zone 3 Seshego. It was also learned that Ntsie studied Leadership and Management Course at the college about five years ago. Mokaba-Phukwana said the commitment of and work done by the college is highly appreciated. Learning must prioritise and encompass a societal challenge that deals with moral related issues to develop and direct our own discourse as a nation. We need independent thinkers to shape our destiny as the nation, she said. She added that people need to conveniently deviate from popular held view that scholarly learning should produce servants for masters who control the means of production and wealth. Campaigns against the abuse of vulnerable people within the society must find resonance with the school curriculum. Children should know from an early age that people are all equal regardless of race, gender or wealth Mokaba-Phukwana explained. She further urged graduates to continue working hard and make use of their qualifications to earn a decent living. Story: ENDY SENYATSI &gt;&gt;endy@observer.co.za
