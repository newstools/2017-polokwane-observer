The Limpopo Promoters Association (LPA) and Department of Sport, Arts and Culture intend unveiling plans to revive boxing in the province at a mini symposium set to take place in Polokwane on 17 July. The association s new Executive Committee will also be elected and announced at the event. Departmental officials, representatives of local and district municipalities, Boxing South Africa, boxing promoters from all districts as well as officials from the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee are expected to attend the event. Spokesperson for the Department Sport, Arts and Culture, Kola Maila said among the core issues to be discussed on the day will be finding a way to take boxing to all areas in the province and ensure that every aspiring boxer has a platform to showcase his or her talent . Boxing in the province is limping because the promoters were not united. They recently met with MEC Onicca Moloi and are now more united. They told her about their plans. They want to ensure that regular development boxing tournaments are held in all the districts and townships. They also want boxing programmes in all the municipalities and they want members of mayoral committees to come and learn how to implement the sport in their respective municipalities. Together we can take the sport to greater heights, Maila said. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert.observer@gmail.com &nbsp;
