Polokwane Municipality started to evict illegal occupants of stands in Disteneng this morning. This comes despite a protest action that was staged on Nelson Mandela Drive near the entrance to this settlement last Wednesday after residents learned about the intended eviction. Communications and Marketing Manager of the municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo confirmed that the eviction of illegal occupants was necessary to facilitate the placement of identified legal occupants of the planned redeveloped township. The new township that will include residential and business stands as well as other facilities such as schools is planned there and some residents are already accommodated on their allocated stands. The illegals are obstructing the redevelopment of the township in accordance with the proposed lay-out and have to be removed to allow for the installation of permanent municipal services to legal occupants, Mothapo explained. Mothapo could however not confirm when the installation of permanent services would commence. Mothapo indicated that the material of the shacks that are removed are recorded on an inventory and that the owners may reclaim it from the municipality. He also said that some of the illegal occupants removed their shacks by themselves. Story: BARRY VILJOEN &gt;&gt;barryv.observer@gmail.com Illegal occupants of land in Disteneng remove their shacks.
