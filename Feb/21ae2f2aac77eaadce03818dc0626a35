Kgoloko Thobejane, former Baroka Football Club coach was returned to the position temporarily after the club on Sunday suspended its Head Coach, Jacob Sakala and his entire technical team with immediate effect. Sakala, formerly with Mpumalanga Black Aces and Dynamos Football Club took over from Thobejane in January. Chief Executive Officer of the Club, Morgan Mammila on Monday confirmed Sakala s suspension and informed Polokwane Observer of Thobejane s return. We suspended the Coach and his technical team. It is an internal matter and we can t disclose reasons for the suspension because we respect him as the coach. Thobejane will take over for the time being, Mammila said. The Ga-Mphahlele based outfit is currently in the last position of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) with 13 points after 17 matches. In their next three matches they will face strong PSL title contenders Kaizer Chiefs, currently leading the pack with 33 points, Cape Town City Football Club who is in second position on 32 points and Super Sport United on 29 and in fourth place. Mammilla said they are not worried playing against the top title contenders because they have never lost against them. We have never lost against those teams and we are confident that we will do well. We are not worried about other teams.What we can promise our fans and supporters is that won t be relegated. We need them in numbers at our home and away matches, he concluded. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za &nbsp;
