The South African Football Association s Transnet School of Excellence in Johannesburg will give ambitious young soccer players an opportunity to showcase their talent during their talent identification roads shows set to take place at Lesley Manyathela Stadium in Musina and Jane Furse Stadium in the Sekhukhune area on Saturday and Sunday respectively. Principal of the School, Joseph Molele said all players born in 2005 and currently in Grade 7 will be eligible to participate in the road show. We are urging all interested players to arrive early for registration which will take place between 8:00 and 11:00. Each hopeful must bring along a certified copy of his mother s identity document, his South African birth certificate, 2016 year-end school report, their own soccer kits and meals for the day, Molele said. Asked why they choose to stage the roadshow in Musina and Sekhukhune as opposed to Polokwane, Molele said they wanted to give aspiring soccer players from remote areas a chance. We want to offer them an opportunity to succeed at the highest level of professional football. Furthermore this gives opportunity to youngsters who find it difficult to afford a good education fused with great sporting facilities and coaching, Molele said. For the past 23 years the school has developed, groomed and launched a number of bright careers through continuous passion for sport development, academics and life skills. Most notably stars includes, Steven Pienaar (Sunderland Football Club, England) Keagan Dolly (Montpellier, France) Bernard Parker (Kaizer Chiefs), Aubrey Modiba (Super Sport United), Phakamani Mahlambi (Bidvest Wits) and Mahlatse Makhudubele (Orlando Pirates). Selected players from all provinces will attend a camp in Johannesburg later this year and afterwards compete for places in in the 2017 team.
