It was a colourful affair when Mitchell House Grade 00 to Grade 12 learners supported the Cansa Shavathon initiative last Friday by having their hair sprayed. Although officially called Shavathon Month the learners however preferred the colour spray option rather than shaving off their hair. Cansa Fundraiser Ren Robberts said the powder paint used is harmless and can be washed off without much effort. Learners paid R20 to participate all of which goes towards Cansa. At time of going to print Mitchell House Marketing Manager Achsah Phoshoko could not provide the amount that was raised.

A brave looking Potego Motimele, Grade 0, allows Cansa Superintendent Poppy Ramohlale to spray her hair for a good cause.
