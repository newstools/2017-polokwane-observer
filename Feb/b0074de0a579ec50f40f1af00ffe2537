South African Property Owners Association (Sapoa) Limpopo will be hosting an engagement session with commercial and industrial property owners on the City of Polokwane s 2017-2022 Integrated Development Plan (IDP) on 20 February. In a Sapoa media release the IDP was summarised as a five-year municipal strategic plan developed by the residents in conjunction with the municipality and reviewed on an annual basis. The key areas of performance that the municipality needs to incorporate in the IDP include spatial analysis, service delivery, local economic development, municipal transformation and organisational development, municipal financial viability and management, good governance and public participation. Sapoa considers all these key areas as vital to the property sector and participation of commercial and industrial property owners will allow for the industry to effectively engage with the city. The venue is the Aurecon Auditorium in Platinum Park in Polokwane. &nbsp;
