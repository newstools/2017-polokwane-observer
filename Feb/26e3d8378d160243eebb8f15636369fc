A team from Netball South Africa is expected to be at the Polokwane Municipality s netball courts next to the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on 18 February to finalise the Limpopo Baobabs team that will represent the province at the Brutal Fruit Netball Premier League set to commence in April in Durban. President of Limpopo Netball Association, Christine Skwambana said the 30 players that were selected during the trials held at various districts in the province fortnight ago will battle for a spot in the first team. We are looking for only 15 players from that number. It is going to be tough, we want a strong team that will compete against the best. We did not do well in the league last year and finished the league in the last position. That did not sit well with us and we want to improve hence we had open trials and we are hoping for a better team, Skwambana said. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za &nbsp;
