Polokwane City Football Club will be hoping to continue with their current exciting form when they host Maritzburg United in their 16th match of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on 8 February. City, currently comfortably in fifth position, has amassed 21 points after 15 matches. A victory against Maritzburg United could see them elevated to the second position. Since their promotion to the elite league in 2012, City has won four matches against Maritzburg and lost only two. Head Coach Luc Eymael is confident that his charges will do well against Maritzburg United and continue with a good record they have against them . We want to finish the league in the top 8 bracket and we will do our best to achieve that. The boys are focused and they understand the pressure that comes with their position because every team wants to beat us, Eymael said. Meanwhile Maritzburg, who appointed former Orlando Pirates Coach Roger de Sa as coach in December, will rely on the on-form Zimbabwean international Brian Onyango and their captain Kurt Lentjies do deliver against Polokwane City.
