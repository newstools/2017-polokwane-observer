Marakele National Park s popular event, the Marakele Marathon will take place on 8 April. The race is a Comrades qualifier and organised by SanParks in partnership with SanParks Honorary Rangers and Thabazimbi Marathon Club. This is a unique marathon which takes place inside the park and aims to bring both the public as well as the running community together to take a run on the wild side. It also focuses the public and the media s attention on the importance of conservation and highlights fundraising and tourism initiatives which are key to the functioning of a national park, SanParks Regional Communications Manager for the northern region, Divhani Maremba stated in a media release. Participants can enter any one of three races, 42,2 km, 21,1 km or 10 km. There is also a 5 km fun run, which is very popular among children and casual supporters. Participants are limited to 300 runners per race, but there is no limit on the 5 km fun run. According to Marakele s Park Manager, Mphadeni Nthangeni, the marathon has gained much support, as getting an opportunity to run in a big five national park is a thrilling feeling and this event offers it to participants. The proceeds from this marathon will go to the Honorary Rangers who will plough it back into the park towards conservation activities, he said.
