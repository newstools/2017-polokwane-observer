Two suspects believed to have been terrorising off-campus students of the University of Limpopo (UL) appeared in the Mankweng Magistrate s Court on Tuesday. Provincial Police Corporate Communication Head Motlafela Mojapelo could not provide the names of the suspects neither the outcome of the court case by the time of going to print. He could also not confirm any protest by community members during the court session. Both suspects were arrested in Unit D, Mankweng during an intelligence led operation over the weekend. They are possibly linked to cases of theft, rape, attempted murder and robbery committed in the area since last year. One of the cases includes the incident in October last year where they tried to break in to an apartment. When the occupant of the apartment screamed for help, a neighbour approached but was allegedly shot by the suspects, Mojapelo said, adding that they might also be linked to the most recent incident earlier this month when a student was reportedly raped and robbed of her cell phone and laptop. During the arrest Police confiscated a 9 mm pistol and ammunition, five laptops and six cell phones. They appeared on charges of possession of suspected stolen property, illegal firearm and ammunition. More charges might be added to the charge sheet.
