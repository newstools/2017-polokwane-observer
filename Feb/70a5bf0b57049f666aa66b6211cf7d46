Sport, Arts and Culture MEC Onicca Moloi has called on the private sector to support athletes with disability and ensure that they are able to participate in competitions and tournaments without hindrances. Moloi delivered the welcome address at the opening of the South African Open Summer Games for the Intellectually Impaired which commenced at various sport facilities in the city on Monday and is expected to end on Friday (tomorrow). The codes in which athletes from all nine provinces competed are swimming, table tennis, cricket and blackball. We must double our efforts and support athletes with disability because sport breaks barriers and also creates employment. We need funding for our athletes with special needs because we want them to the best athletes and make something out of their talent. There are so many talented athletes in our remote areas but they are unable to take their talents further because they don t have enough sport facilities, Moloi said. She said they were proud to host the games and wished all the athletes and team managers a good stay in the province. Lizzy Vogel, President of South African Sports Association for the Intellectually Impaired also wished all the athletes the best of luck at the games. May we participate in good spirit, always remembering to compete in fair play and make new friends, Vogel told the athletes. She also thanked the event organisers, coaches, principals, provincial committees, local organising committee and the department for ensuring that the event is a success. Official results are set to be release tomorrow at the closing ceremony where Vogel an Education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe will preside.
