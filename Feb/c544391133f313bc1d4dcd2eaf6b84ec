An urgent application of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Limpopo against Lepelle-Nkumpi Municipality, its Speaker and entire council that was brought before the Polokwane High Court on Tuesday was reportedly struck from the roll on the basis of not being urgent. Outside court acting EFF Provincial Chairperson Rendani Munyai explained that the municipality, council and Speaker of Lepelle-Nkumpi in Lebowakgomo were listed as defendants in the application on behalf of the EFF in the province and its representative councillors on Lepelle-Nkumpi Council. She afterwards indicated they were still in consultation with their lawyers to determine the way forward. She explained that the application stemmed from perceived action related to resolutions taken for implementation without their councillors being in agreement or present. She claimed the same situation prevailed elsewhere in the province, such as Tubatse, and that they intended to take on other municipalities and councils as well.
