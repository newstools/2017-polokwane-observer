After a delay of a year Seshego Stadium will be ready for use in March after the upgrades to the tune of R9,7 m were completed. Director Community Development at Polokwane Municipality, Ndavhe Ramakuela has assured residents and users that the 8 000 seat facility was set to be completed last year March. The upgrades, started in 2014, were hampered by contractors who allegedly failed to meet the deadline, protesters who allegedly blocked the entrance to the venue with stones and burning tyres while accusing Polokwane Municipality of using the same contractors over and over, not giving others opportunities. We are done with the upgrades. We have upgraded the dressing rooms, we have installed the new irrigation system, the drainage system, new lights, parameter fence and turnstiles, Ramakuela said. He also mentioned pavilion seats will also be numbered to ensure total holding capacity. The stadium is now developed to national standards that would allow it to host national and international events. We will also be able to host night events, Ramakuela said. Frank Letago from Seshego s Zone 1 said: It is definitely good news for the people of this area. The Premier Soccer League will now bring some of the National First Division and Mutlichoice Diski Challenge matches here. We will no longer have to travel to the city or to Venda to see those matches because we will be having our own top class facility.
