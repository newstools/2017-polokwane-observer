Despite losing their crucial Premier Soccer League (PSL) match against Chippa United last Tuesday, Baroka Football Club team members are optimistic that they will do well against Bidvest Wits when the two meet at Bidvest Stadium in Gauteng on 22 February. Baroka is currently rooted in the last position the league with 12 points after 16 matches and they will need maximum points to survive relegation. Meanwhile, Wits who are strong contenders for PSL title are in 4th position of the league with 28 points after 14 matches. Long serving Baroka player Khunadi Nkoana believes they can get three points against the MTN 8 Champions. They are a well organised side with a good coach but we have to win the match. We are in a precarious position and if we don t win matches we will find ourselves in the gutter and that is not where we want to go. We played well against Chippa but we conceded a last minute goal that killed us, but we are playing very well, Nkoana said. Another player, Nkosinathi Ndlovu who played a pivotal role in the team s promotion to the PSL last season said they have the arsenal to win against Wits. We are aware of our position of the league and the threat Bidvest Wits poses but these are the kind of teams we should beat in order to get out of this position and we are confident that we will do it, Ndlovu said.
