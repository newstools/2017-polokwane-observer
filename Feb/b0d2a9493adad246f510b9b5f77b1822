Polokwane City Football Club will hope to improve on its performance against Orlando Pirates when the two meet at Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Saturday. The two teams played to a 1-1 draw at the new Peter Mokaba Stadium in the first round of the Premier Soccer League last October. Head Coach of Polokwane City Football, Luc Eymael has promised the team s supporters that they will come back home with three points. We played well against them in the first round unfortunately we could come out with the desired results. We are ready for them, we have studied their weakness and strengths and I am confident that we will win the match, Eymael said. He added that the return of striker Puleng Tlolane, who has recuperated from an arm injury sustained against Super Sport United in December last year, was welcomed. He has healed, we are just working on his fitness and we are hoping that he will be fit for the Pirates match, Eymael said. City lies in position six of the league with 24 points after 18 matches while Pirates are in tenth position with 20 points after 17 matches.
