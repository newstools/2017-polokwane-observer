Marathon fever was in the air when Capricorn District Executive Mayor John Mpe launched the Capricorn 4-in-One, a Comrades and Two Oceans qualifier planned for 18 February, during a media conference in Polokwane on Friday. With race ambassadors Ludwick Mamabolo and Rufus Photo present at the occasion, Mpe announced sponsorship of an estimated R50 000 towards the costs of the participation of the two multi-medallists in the two big national marathons later this year. He simultaneously committed Capricorn District Municipality (CDM) to making available transport to participating athletes from the district to travel to this year s Comrades Marathon. With a total prize money of R50 000 up for grabs the Capricorn 4-in-One, which will commence at Polokwane C rugby field behind old Peter Mokaba Stadium at 06:00 and 06:10 respectively, allows for runners of all age groups to participate in the 5 km, 10 km, 21,1 km and 42,2 km categories at entry fees of R30, R50, R100 and R140.
