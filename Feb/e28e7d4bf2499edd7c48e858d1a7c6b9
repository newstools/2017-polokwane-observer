Polokwane City Football Club midfielder Nazier Jacobs has re-joined the team having recovering from a car accident. Jacobs was in a critical condition following the accident in March last year. Polokwane City Football Club Head Coach, Luc Eymael confirmed that the player has fully recovered from his injuries and will be available for the upcoming matches. Their next match will be against the relegation threatened Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Sunday. The match will be a test for us especially after a long break but we have to do well, said Eymael.
