Black Leopards Football Club achieved a convincing 4-1 victory against their provincial arch-rivals Magesi Football Club at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday to cement their second position in the National First Division (NFD). Former Pirates striker, Mwape Musonda scored a hat-trick for Lidoda Duvha while veteran defender Elias Ngwepe scored the only goal for Magesi. The feat puts Leopards in the promotional play-offs spot with 47 points from 48 matches while are Magesi still languishing in 15th place with 28 points. Leopards Spokesperson, Berry Ramunenyiwa said they had to win the match in order to realise their dreams of playing in the Premier Soccer League next season. It was one of those tricky matches. Magesi was a threat because they are fighting for relation and they were going to come at us but we managed to contain them, Ramunenyiwa said. With only two games left before the season comes to an end Ramunenyiwa said they have to double their efforts so that teams below them don t remove them from their position. Behind us are Stellenbosch FC who have 46 points and Amazulu, Royal Eagles and Witbank Spurs who are all on 44 points. We can t afford to slip up because if they win their remaining matches and we lose we are in trouble. We thought we would get automatic promotion but it was not be. We have a second chance in the play-offs provided we qualify and I think we have all the experience to deal with them, Ramunenyiwa said. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za &nbsp;
