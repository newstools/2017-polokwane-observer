Grade 4 to 7 learners of Mitchell House recently took part in a Science Fair, aimed to promote passion for Science and Technology, and spent weeks preparing for this event. In the Pure Science and Investigations category learners had to devise a question and develop a hypothesis to answer the question. They were expected to follow a scientific method and be able to conduct a fair test to either prove or disprove their hypothesis. The learners therefore required a good understanding of how to conduct a test and control variables. In the Technology and Design category, contestants had to build or develop a product designed to solve a need by following a process which included research, design, making, and evaluating their product during each stage. Adjudicators Marianne Alberts, Nkhumbu Mahada. Antoaneta Letsoalo, Sareh Tavakol and Ali Halajian asked each candidate questions. The topic, evidence of research and application of the scientific method or technological process accounted for 75% of the maks awarded.
