The blood supply levels of the South African National Blood Services (SANBS) Limpopo was given a boost last Wednesday when learners of Noorderland High School made a generous contribution during a donor clinic held at the school. The SANBS-Limpopo mobile team who set out at 08:00 with the hope of attaining a target of 34 units had by 14:00 successfully harvested 37 units of blood. Grade 11-learner and SANBS-Limpopo Peer Promoter at the school, Choene Mohoto was excited to report: The learners are participating well and so far we are doing better than the last donor session. The service was in desperate need of donations following the Easter weekend and school holidays that had drained its stock. SANBS Limpopo Public Relations Officer Dottie Pinn urged schools to continue rallying their learners to donate blood. Regular donors, new volunteers and persons wanting to know more about becoming a donor are requested to report to their nearest SANBS-branch to help replenish the blood reserves.
