Grade 8 and 9 learners from Ho r Tegniese Skool Tom Naud (Tommies) are now benefiting from a world-class educational solution after the opening of a reading centre at the school last Wednesday. Tommies is the first school in Limpopo to have partnered with Lectorsa, a South African based company that has researched and developed first to market education solutions for the past 40 years, to introduce the LAB-on-line Solution to learners. The solution focusses on mind activation and builds new neuron pathways to form a structure to interact with information. LAB-on-line develops efficient skills and strategies for students to access and process information to form concepts that will lead to better academic results, according to Lectorsa Media Relations Officer Jolandi Fourie. Principal Piet Holtzhausen said bringing the best solution to equip learners is top priority for the school. We have researched a number of possible educational tools before investing in this creative and smart learning solution and we look forward to reaping the benefits, he said.
