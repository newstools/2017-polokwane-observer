T wo people were killed by community members in separate incidents relating to mob-justice on the weekend. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said they are still searching for a group of community members who allegedly killed a 31-year-old man whom they accused of various crimes in Hlogotlou on Sunday. It is alleged that the man went to his girlfriend s house in Monsterlus and upon his arrival reportedly attacked her and her younger sister. He attempted to douse them with petrol and set them alight. Ngoepe added that a friend of the two women saw the ordeal and called for help. Community members quickly mobilised and chased the man to a point where he was allegedly caught and stoned to death. The two women sustained serious injuries and were admitted to a local hospital. Police in Mankweng are on a manhunt for a group of community members who stoned to death a 24-year-old suspected criminal at Nobody on Saturday. It is alleged that the man, thought to have killed Lawrence Ngaletsane Botabota at a liquor outlet the previous night, was assaulted and succumbed to injuries sustained during the stoning. We once again warn communities to stop taking the law into their own hands and rather inform the Police to handle the situation. We are not going to leave any stone unturned until every person involved in these two incidents are arrested, Ngoepe warned. Anyone with information can contact the investigating officer William Ramokhubedu on 082 499 8389. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
