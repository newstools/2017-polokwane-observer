Regular and social golf players were among the 84 fun seekers that supported the Mitchell House Golf Day held at the Polokwane Golf Club recently. The weather was excellent and while some players took the competition quite serious there were those that merely participated to support a good cause and have fun. The competition was in 4 Ball Alliance Ghost Scorecard format and the winners was the team of Dwayne Viljoen, Thys de Kock, Gerhard Saaiman and Walter du Plessis with 95 points, followed by Nic Notley, Glen Wynne, Nikon Koster and Barend Wessels on 88 points. Matsobane Tleane, Simphiwe Mdalose, Joe Legora and Joas Tshikundamelema were third with 84 points. Joas Tshikundamelema was nearest to the pin on the 8th and Thys de Kock took the longest drive on the 18th. Mitchell House Headmaster Andrew Cook took the challenge with team mates Shaun Minnie, Emwee Zeelie and Ian Houston and although the team did not finish within the first 14, Cook commented that the game had been fun. We appreciate the support of our sponsors and players that made this day a great success, Cook said.
