Winter will have to take a back seat at the Polokwane Show Grounds when red hot action sparks up at the Polokwane Oval Raceway during their Winter Trophy Championships on Saturday. The championships is a precursor to the National Raceway Championships that will take place at the Kilarney Race Track. Local 2.1 litre modified class drivers are preparing late into the night every day to show that they are the best in South Africa, the club said in a media release recently. Our 2.1 litre drivers do not ask or give an inch, they only go for gold. Spectators will not be disappointed. Drivers from Polokwane Oval Raceway Club, The Rock Raceway in Brakpan, Mahem Raceway in Pretoria, Klerksdorp Raceway, Richardsbaai Raceway, Rietkuil and Mokopane Raceway will compete for the Winter Trophy and face legends like local brothers Johnny and Rudolf du Randt as well as dark horses Desmond Bosch, Pieter Venter and Haccum Hough. Visiting driver Andr Swarts has never disappointed in Polokwane, but local drivers are gunning for Hannes Brits since Brits recorded record breaking times at the Ultimate Raceway. Roelf van der Merwe from Rietkuil and his 2.1 litre team complete the 2.1 litre grid. Rookies, ninjas, rebels, F2 midgets, stockrods, 1 600-modifieds, hotrods, super saloons and sprints will complete the programme. Gates will open at 11:00 and there will be plenty of stalls and entertainment available until the racing action starts at 17:00. Entry fees are R50 per adult and R20 per child under 12.
