Baroka Football Club s skilful midfielder Mxolisi Kunene prudly accepted the Absa Premiership Goal of the Month award on Monday during the monthly Player, Coach and Goal of the Month awards presented at the Premier Soccer League (PSL) offices on Monday. Kunene s stunning goal against Amakhosi at the Peter Mokaba stadium on 18 March motivated the award. His score originated from a great, breakaway solo run from the halfway line and saw him evading more than five Kaizer Chiefs players to neatly pass Itumeleng Khune and scoring the equalizer to ensure his team a 2-2 draw. Kunene is the second Baroka player to get the award after goalkeeper Oscarine Masukule who in November became the first outfield player to win the award since the inception of thereof. The winning monthly goal is chosen by online votes from football supporters and the general public, who pick their favourite goal through the league s website. Each of the goals selected during the monthly voting will go towards the list of goals that will be voted for the Absa-lutely Goal of the Season at the end of the season. Kunene thanked his teammates, technical team and coaches for the support. It was a team effort. I could not have scored that goal if was not for the help of my teammates. I dedicate this award to everyone in the team, Kunene said. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za &nbsp;
