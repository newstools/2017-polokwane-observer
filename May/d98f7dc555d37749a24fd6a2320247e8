Grade 12 learner Tebogo Mokhari from Northern Academy Secondary School was recently named Limpopo SleepOut Ambassador. Tebogo was chosen out of 70 hopefuls from different high schools countrywide who were vying for the title and the only one from the province. Tebogo who is also head girl at her school will be tasked to spread a message of positive social change and she will also be a vital mouthpiece of change, support to female business leaders and encourage fellow learners to participate in SleepOut movement. The movement was created by a social entrepreneurship collective that collaborates with businesses to change heart and mind-sets, and find new approaches to philanthropy. The initiative is part of a global movement, effecting positive social change for vulnerable and homeless communities. It asks business leaders to spend a winter s night on the streets, raising funds and empathy for the homeless. Founded in Australia in 2006, the movement is now a global initiative, with SleepOuts taking place in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom a well. Tebogo will participate in the SleepOut event at her school in June where she will be joined by her fellow learners , parents and educators to spend a night outdoors on their school grounds, garnering empathy for the homeless and vulnerable communities, and collecting funds for other beneficiaries in need in solidarity with the SleepOut chapter. Afterwards she will collect baby items for Ngwana Baby House, one of several beneficiaries in the province. Dates for the two events will be announced by the movement in due course. Tebogo reportedly said being a SleepOut Ambassador is knowing that you are using your advantages to change the life of someone else. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za &nbsp;
