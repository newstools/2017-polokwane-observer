Police, in response to the increasing number of persons being reported as missing recently, are continuing their battle to solve such cases. In the latest of these incidents last week Police discovered that a missing person from Masisi outside Thohoyandou had indeed been kidnapped and was found in Johannesburg three days later. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the 17-year-old boy was last seen when he visited a local clinic and used public transport to proceed to Donald Fraser Hospital last Monday. Police engaged in a massive search until last Thursday morning when investigations revealed that his girlfriend had called him later on the day he went missing and was told he had been kidnapped but did not know where he was being held. Police intensified their investigations and found him in Gauteng where he is currently recuperating from injuries sustained during the alleged kidnapping. The motive behind the incident is not clear and investigations continue. In a separate incident Police need help to locate Kuvhanganani Peter Sithagu from Thohoyandou who went missing last Monday.
