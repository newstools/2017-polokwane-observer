Baroka Football Club s seemingly futile battle to avoid relegation in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) continued at the new Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday when they yet again could only manage a 0-0 draw against 15th placed Highlands Park Football Club. Bakgakga went into the match desperately in need of points in order to improve their position in the league, but failed in their mission. Kgoloko Thobejane s men created a plethora of scoring chances in both halves of the match, but were unable to convert them and the result puts them in 16th position with 25 points after 29 matches. Club Spokesperson Jimmy Ngobeni said they could have won the match but luck was not on their side. It was a tough match but we played well in both halves it just that we were unable to score the goals. Highlands Parks came with different tactics that stopped us from playing our normal football and they succeeded, Ngobeni said. In their last match of the 2016/17 PSL season they will hope for three points against the inform Ajax Cape Town when the two clash at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. In the first round of the League the two teams played to a 1-1 draw at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium in August last year. Ngobeni described the upcoming match as one of the crucial fixtures of the season which they have to win in order to move out of the relegation zone. It is the last match of the season which we must win to save our PSL status and we are confident that we will attain victory, Ngobeni said.
