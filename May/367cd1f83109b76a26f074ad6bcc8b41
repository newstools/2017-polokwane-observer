Local motocross riders gathered at the Capricorn Racing Club (CRC) for a day filled with speed, dirt, high flying bikes and fun on Saturday. According to Dean Rudiger, CRC Chairperson, the day was intended to be enjoyable for the different racers with no competition or prize giving at the end of the day. The racers use days like these to prepare and practice for the upcoming races he explained. Racers could enter at random for the day. The experienced riders took on the motocross track while the older men raced on the flat track and the youngsters raced each other on the kids motocross track. Three heats were raced on each track. The riders showed some exceptional skill on the motocross and flat track, where Darrel Lehamn and Eckhard van Heerden led the pack. On the kids motocross track some of the youngsters were learning to ride the track and honed their skills on their bikes. Four-year-old Albert Hatting perfected his four wheeler skills on his 50 cc quad bike, while Aaron Schoeman looked like a professional on his 50 cc Yamaha PW bike. Rudiger urged the community to come and support the motocross as the CRC aims to develop the sport in Polokwane by hosting fun days. Any riders are welcome to join regardless of age and rider experience.
