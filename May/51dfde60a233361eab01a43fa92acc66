Zimbabwean national Gibson Banda was sentenced to two life terms and an additional 21 years imprisonment during a Limpopo High Court sitting in Thohoyandou on Tuesday for the murder of Johan Greyvenstein and his wife Annelise outside Musina in November 2010. National Prosecuting Authority Communications Manager Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said Banda was found guilty on two counts of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. The bodies of the Greyvenstein couple were found in their Toyota Hilux bakkie three days after they were last seen on 2 November 2010. It is reported that the couple was visiting their daughter after doing some shopping in the border town. A neighbour later called the Police and reported that he has not seen the couple for three days. Their bakkie was found on the road several meters from their homestead. Both had been shot in the head, according to Malabi-Dzhangi. Banda was arrested soon after the discovery of the bodies and was found in possession of a revolver and ammunition, two silver watches, a video recorder, DVD player, welding machine and two bicycles belonging to the couple, according to Malabi-Dzhangi. Banda was a former employee of the couple. Judge Khami Makhafola in his sentencing mentioned that both deceased were murdered in a brutal and inhuman manner. He further stated that the accused failed to provide the court with substantial and compelling circumstances to deviate from the minimum prescribed sentence, according to Malabi-Dzhangi. Banda was sentenced to life imprisonment for each count of murder, 15 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances and three years on each count of unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition.
