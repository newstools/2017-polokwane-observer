The fourth annual Run/Walk for Life/A da Road Race held at Laerskool Pietersburg-Noord Primary on Saturday was a great success despite a lower number of entries. Anton Hanekom, Principal of A da Polokwa ne said the race drew approximately 500 entries which was 200 less than the previous year. He attributed the decline to various other sports events taking place in the city on Saturday. He expressed his satisfaction with the outcome of the event and added that the race was A da s way of giving back to the community and thanking them for their continued support. Each athlete received a medal and the winners received goodie bags containing a number of useful items such as lip balm, a towel and key ring. The event offered a 5 km fun run, as well as a 10 and 15 km road race. The event took place without hiccups except when the lead car failed to turn off at the 15 km marker and led the longer distance runners on a shorter route, thereby cancelling their official times. The event organisers decided to award the medals based on the positions the runners finished in. The winner of the men s 10 km road race open- and veteran category was Betuel Netshitenze in a time of 32:00, while Joyce Netshifhefhe won the women s open category in 41:44. In the men s 15 km race open category, Lutendo Mapoto was the winner while Gift Ramobele took first place in the women s open category.
