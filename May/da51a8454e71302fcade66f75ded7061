More than 624 cross country athletes from the province braved inclement weather to participate in the second leg of the 2017 league hosted by Limpopo Athletics (Lima) at Ho r Tegniese Skool Tom Naud . Harry Strauss, Cross Country Organiser at the school said the event was part of Lima s preparation for team selection for the South African Cross Country Championship that will take place at Pot chefstroom on 9 September. Athletes varying in age from eight to 79 participated over 1, 4, 6, 8 and 10 km to try and improve their times and possibly secure themselves a place in the provincial team. Strauss said the final team will be announced by the Limpopo athletics committee after the completion of the third and the fourth league set for Moletjie and Stanford Lake College respectively in the remaining week of May. He could not quantify the number of athletes that would be selected and said every athlete who qualifies is eligible to the team.
