While the African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo mourns the death of three ANC Women s League members after an accident in Moletji on Saturday, the driver of the vehicle allegedly responsible for the accident Simon Phukhubye, was granted bail of R1 000 and will appear in the Seshego Magistrate s Court again on 28 July to face charges of driving under the influence of alcohol, culpable homicide and reckless and negligent driving. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that at around 09:30 at Lukama village the driver of a Nissan NP200-bakkie allegedly lost control of his vehicle and plunged into a group of five women waiting for transport next to the road. Three were killed instantly while the other two were seriously injured and taken to hospital. Phukhubye was arrested soon after the accident and appeared in court on Monday when he was granted bail and the case postponed to July. In a press statement by ANC Provincial Secretary Nocks Seabi the women were identified as Nora Koenaite, Violet Veronica Ledwaba and Mavis Mmonoa. These comrades were on their way to attend the Molo Makhelwane Campaign, an organisational activity, at Segopye village. These were committed cadres of our movement who had dedicated their lives in the betterment of our society in general and the emancipation of women particularly, Seabi s statement read. He added that the ANC never had appropriate words to appreciate their contribution to the life and blood of the organisation nor can they ever express in articulate terms the depth of their sadness on their untimely departure. We wish the injured a speedy recovery and our deepest and heartfelt condolences go to the families, friends and relatives of the deceased. May their souls rest in peace.
