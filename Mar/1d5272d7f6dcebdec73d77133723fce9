The 2017 Sun City to Table Bay Charity Cycle Tour started at Meropa Casino and Entertainment World recently when 35 cyclists took part in a 60 km exhibition ride to Chuenespoort and back as warm-up to their marathon ride. The 2 222 km tour is in its 15th year and the aim is to raise funds for charity. Since Meropa is also celebrating its 15th birthday this year, this Sun International product is supporting the tour and served as point of departure. The charity handover was attended by delegates from the selected charities who each received their share of R125 000. These Polokwane based beneficiaries include the Cansa Tough Living with Cancer ward which received R50 000, Ngwana Baby House received R45 000 and Luthuli Park Combined School that received R30 000. Also in attendance was Mabakane Mangena, acting HOD for the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture. The cyclists will stop at Sun International s Carousel Casino where they will hand over more donations to Waterberg based charities. The 2017 Sun City to The Table Bay Charity Cycle Tour will cover an average of 220 km per day and stop at ten towns where the cyclist will hand out donations of more than R600 000 in total.
