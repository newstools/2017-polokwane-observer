Former Kiwi Double Seven Football Club striker, Bernard Molekwa is to take over as interim coach at Polokwane City Football Club until the end of the season. Molekwa has been offered the position by club management following the departure of Belgian Luc Eymael a fortnight ago. Known as Taxi in the football circles Molekwa showed his coaching acumen when City drew against the reining Premier Soccer League (PSL) Champions, Mamelodi Sundowns at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Pretoria last Tuesday. The Bakenberg born mentor said he was grateful for the opportunity he has been given by the club management and he believes he can do well in the last remaining nine matches of the League. I am looking forward to the challenge. It think I will do well. I have been at the club for eight years. I played for the club at some point, but most of the time I was on the bench as an assistant Coach and I have learned a lot about the game and I am ready, Molekwa said. Chief Operations Officer of Polokwane City Football Club, Tincy Tema said they opted for Molekwa because he was a loyal servant of the club. He has been in the club for some time. He has football knowledge, he is honest and we also felt he has all the experience to lead the team, Tema said. His second match will be against the relegation bound Bloemfontein Celtic at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on 1 April. Molekwa admitted that the match will be tough because of Celtic s position in the League. They are in a good position of the league and they want points. We are going to fight and give a good performance on the day and ensure that we consolidate our position in the league, Molekwa said. City is currently in 6th position of the league with 27 points while Celtic lies precariously on the 14th position of the league with 19 points.
