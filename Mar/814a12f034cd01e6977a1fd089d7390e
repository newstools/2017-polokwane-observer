The heat and dust created by competing petrol heads at the Polokwane 4&#215;4 Club s track on the Silicon road did nothing to deter their audience and drivers from thoroughly enjoying themselves last Saturday. Martin Groenewald, organiser of the challenge had a small hiccup and caused a lot of mirth when his super modified vehicle tipped onto its side, but there were a lot of willing hands to right the car on its wheels again. AutoZone sponsored the prizes of the day while lively music, food prepared by Kobie Groenewald and with Leatitia Groenewald being the marshal added to the success of the day. The club will compete in Mokopane on 25 March and enthusiasts can look forward to an inter-club competition between the Louis Trichardt, Mokopane and Polokwane clubs on 29 April. In the standard class the winner was Billy Pistorius, followed by Charles van der Walt and Billy s dad Chris. The modified class was won by Bernard Radmore in his cheeky yellow Jeep, followed by Eugene Greyling and Niekie Oosthuizen. Rudolph Durandt was the king of the super modifieds with his brother Johnny in second place and Martin Groenewald in third position.
