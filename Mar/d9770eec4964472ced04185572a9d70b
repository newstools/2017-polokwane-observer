Luc Eymael resigned as Polo kwane City Football Club coach last week to join Bloemfontein Celtic Football Club. The Belgian born coach joined the club last July following the departure of Julio Leal. During his tenure he won six matches, drew 11 and lost five out of 20 matches of the Premier Soccer League leaving the club in the seventh position. His last game in charge was the Nedbank Cup round of 32 fixture against African All Stars at Peter Mokaba Stadium last Wednesday evening which they won 3 -1. The club s Chief Operations Officer, Tincy Tema could not divulge reasons for Eymael s departure but thanked him for helping the club. Unfortunately we can t divulge the reasons for his departure. All we can say is that we parted ways amicably and we wish him the best, Tema said. A statement on Bloemfontein Celtic Football Club s website quoted Eymael to have said: I am happy to join a team of such incredible stature with massive support. When I first arrived in the country, I somehow had a soft spot for the team purely because of the passion and dedication displayed by the supporters and, trust me, I share the same thirst to win. My philosophy is simple, to play good football with appropriate tactical discipline. I have watched the team before and have seen some exceptionally good players that just need guidance and encouragement to start winning again, the statement read. Tema further informed that former Moria Sweepers Football Club striker, Bernard Molekwa and former Botswana goalkeeper Modiri Marumo will take over on an interim basis. We are in the process of appointing a head coach. We received lot of applications and when it is suitable we will conduct interviews but at the moment Molekwa and Marumo will be in charge of the team, Tema said.
