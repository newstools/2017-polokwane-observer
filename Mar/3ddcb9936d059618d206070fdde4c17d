Polokwane City Football Club s Head Coach, Luc Eymael has promised that there will be no favours when his team meets the struggling Baroka Football Club in the Premier Soccer League s (PSL) Limpopo derby at the new Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday. City is sitting comfortably in the 6th position of the PSL while Baroka is rooted at the bottom of the log with 13 points after 19 matches. In their last three matches City drew against Orlando Pirates, Ajax Cape Town and Maritzburg United and Eymael stressed that they can t afford another stalemate. We also drew against them in the first round of the league in October and we can t afford another draw. We have prepared well for the match, we know that there is a lot at stake such as the pride, the bragging rights and we have prepared to win, Eymael said. Spokesperson for Baroka Football Club, Jimmy Ngobeni said they were well prepared for the clash and will come out as winners. We played tough matches against Wits and Cape Town City in the past weeks which we lost. We learned from those matches and given our position in the league this is a must win match for us, Ngobeni said. Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za &nbsp;
