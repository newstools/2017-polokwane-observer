MotoX enthusiasts can look forward to some adrenaline pumping dirt racing as Capricorn Racing Club (CRC) hosts the first leg of the annual Interprovincial MX Series at their raceway on the Silicon road on Saturday. We urge Polokwane to support the series this year since it was a real success last year and generated good revenue for all the clubs involved. We had good racing and lots of fun at the different tracks. This year the series will be hosted at Polokwane, Phalaborwa and Nelspruit and offers spectators the opportunity for a nice family get-away for a weekend, CRC Chairperson Dean Rudiger said. The series consists of six races with the second leg to be hosted in Nelspruit on 6 May and the third in Phalaborwa on 10 June. We want to stress the fact that anyone can ride. Beginners and professionals, seniors and juniors and MotoX and flat track riders. Classes in which riders can enter are MX 450cc, MX 250cc, MX 125cc, MX 85cc, MX 50cc, MX Veterans and Masters, according to Rudiger. Each class will consist of three heats, weather permitting. Bikers need a World of Motorsport South Africa license available at R220 for six races. Licences are available at the race venue. Entry fees are R350 per race and R200 for a second class entry or additional family member. A full bar and food will be available. For more information contact Rudiger on 082 448 7899.
