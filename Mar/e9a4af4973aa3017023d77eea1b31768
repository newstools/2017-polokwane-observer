Black Leopards Football Club beat the struggling Cape Town All Stars 2-1 at Thohoyandou Stadium in their 21st match of the National First Division (NFD) on Saturday to consolidate their second position. Former Amazulu striker, Mwape Mosunda and Thivhavhudzi Ndou netted for Leopards in the first half of the match. Since coming back from Christmas break they have manage to collect 15 points from 6 matches and thus making their intention of campaigning in the PSL next season clear. Club s Head Coach, Francois Loscuito said he is happy with the team performance since taking over in November last year and he wants to see the team competing in the elite league next. That is the dream of every coach and I want to help the team achieve that. We have nine games left and those games will require a lot from us. We have a lot to do, we must work harder than before. We have a good team and we can assure our supporters that we will double our efforts and ensure that we came out of every match with three points, Loscuito said.
