A quick downpour that had spectators on the open pavilion of Polokwane Oval scramble for cover was not enough to deter drivers in the club championships. Racing enthusiasts were once again treated to some fearless show of skill by the Cooper Drifting Team and the winners of the Valentine s Competition hosted by Polokwane Observer and Polokwane Oval, Douw and Elsie de Beer eagerly joined in an in-car experience. I am an adrenaline junky and it was an awesome experience, Elsie said. Douw had previously joined the Cooper Drifting Team and said he wouldn t mind going over and over again to experience the amazing feeling. Back at the main event Andri Cronj took first place in the Rookies class. Local driver Hennie de Koker claimed first place in the Stockrods as well as a well-deserved third place in the Open class. Young driver Dylan Bosch was handed the chequered flag in the 1660 modified class while Pieter Venter ruled the 2,1 litre modifieds class. Jacques Cronj and Roulph Nel finished first in the Hotrods and Sprints classes respectively.
