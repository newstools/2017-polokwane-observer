According to LIC Club and Facilities Coordinator Sedibu Mohlaba the 2016/2017 season will draw to an end soon. &#8220;Over the last few weeks rain has played havoc as most games got abandoned, however, three teams namely Aces Cricket Club and Eagles Cricket Club both from Polokwane and the Tzaneen based Hornbills stand a chance to be crowned as winners of this season,&#8221; Mohlaba said. Mohlaba added that the winning team of the Premier League will represent LIC at the T20 Multiply Community Cup playoff which comprises of Premier league winners from Easterns Cricket Union, Mpumalanga Titans and Northerns Cricket Union.
