Spectators and organisers of the annual Munnik Meerkat Mountain Bike Challenge had their expectations rewarded when Limpopo s top mountain biker, Alan Gordon from Tzaneen finished first in the 70 km race with 13 minutes to spare before runner-up Mario Ferreira. The event on Saturday saw Gordon finishing in a time of 2:37.30 while Ferreira clocked in at 2:50.40 earning him a second overall place and first place in the veteran category. Theresia Lessing top scored in the female open category of the 70 km with a time of 3:29.32 and was followed by Shirley Scriven, second overall and claiming first place in the veteran category with a time of 3:39.03. The mood of the event was subdued by the unfortunate death of a participant in the 10 km race but the event had to go on. Thirteen-year-old Jarred Watridge took the overall top position in the 10 km for men with a time of 32:31 while Christelle Coetzer was the first woman home in a time of 29:19. In the 35 km race Carel Smit was first to enter the finishing shoot with a time of 1:18.49 in the men s category with Anna-Elisa Gutierrez claiming overall first place among the women with a time of 1:31.53. Thick mist for most of the race created perfect cool conditions for riders. According to statistics by the time keepers 633 biking enthusiasts entered for the respective categories and races. Almost 300 riders entered for the 35 km while 176 lined up for the 10 km.
