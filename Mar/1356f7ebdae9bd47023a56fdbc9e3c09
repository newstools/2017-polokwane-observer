A group of local businessmen and cycling enthusiasts are planning a charity event in which they aim to provide 92 children from Ga-Phago Village in Moletjie with among others, basic food items and blankets on 9 April. Coordinator of the event and fuel station owner in Bochum, Shaun Ramatlhodi invited cyclists to join in the event. It is not only for a good cause but cyclists will have the opportunity to enjoy what they love most by cycling from Polokwane to Moletjie and back. We have already collected food, blankets, clothes and sanitary items which will be donated to children aged between 4 and 15 years, Ramatlhodi said. The group of cyclists will gather at Freshwell, Bendor at 06:45 and leave no later than 07:00. Those interested in donating more items or just to enjoy the ride can contact Ramatlhodi on 083 256 1660 or email on mpsekom@ymail.com. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com &nbsp;
