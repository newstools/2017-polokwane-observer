Polokwane City Football Club interim coach, Bernard Molekwa foresees their Sunday match against Bloemfontein Celtic Football Club to be one of the toughest. City s quest is to cement their top eight position while Celtic are trying hard to avoid relegation at the bottom of the Premier Soccer League (PSL). Celtic has amassed 19 points in 20 matches and City 27 points in 21 matches of the League, a first since their promotion to the PSL in 2012. We have prepared well for the match but we are worried about the threat they pose. They are in the relegation zone and they don t want to lose now. We draw against them in the first round and we can t afford to lose. We know they will come at us but we are ready for the challenge. Again, it is our home match and we have to give our supporters value for their money, Molekwa said. Club General Manager, Tincy Tema said their leading goal scorer Rodney Ramagalela will be available for selection after recuperating from a shoulder injury. Ramagalela, who has scored eight goals this season, dislocated his right shoulder during their 0-0 draw against Baroka Football Club earlier this month. We have a clean bill of health at the team. All players are available for selection. We are again calling all the supporters to come in numbers to the stadium and rally behind the team, Tema said.
