The awards ceremony of the Ironwood Independent Athletics event for primary schools held at the University of Limpopo s Oscar Mpheta Stadium on 24 January was hosted at a function by Eagles Nest Christian School last week. Athlete s performances were evaluated according to the Primary Schools Athletics Performance Evaluation Tables (APE tables) commonly used in schools across the world practicing athletics. Technical standards at entry level differ from those at senior level and the APE tables are compiled based on standards of athletics at entry level in South Africa. The APE is generally used to compare the performance of an athlete in one event against the performance of an athlete in another event, for instance a 100 m sprinter against a long jumper of shot putter. The APE is also used to determine who the Victor and Victrix Ludorum are at athletics meetings. Basani Msimeki from Mitchell House was named the Victrix Ludorum and Phillemon Rametsi from Northview Christian Academy the Victor Ludorum for the event. According to the APE the points Phillemon earned shows his performance to be of international standard. The overall winner of the meeting was PEPPS Polokwane Preparatory School, with a total of 1 028 points, followed by Curro Heuwelkruin (783), Mitchell House (752), Eagle s Nest Christian School (741), Northview Christian Academy (433), Elica Primary School (279), Jabez Christian Academy (163) points and Akademia Reformia on 100 points.
