Black Leopards Football Club has made clear their intention of returning to the elite league when they thrashed Witbank Spurs 1-0 at Thohoyandou Stadium last Saturday to cement their second position in the National First Division (NFD). In their last 19 matches of the division, Lidoda Duvha has managed to amass 33 points and they are seven points away from log leaders Thanda Zulu Royals who are leading the division with 40 points. They will be hoping to collect more points against the seventh placed Stellenbosch Football Club when the two meet at Athlone Stadium in Cape Town on Saturday. Club Spokesperson, Barry Ramunenyiwa said they are happy with the club s performance in the division but predicted a tough journey ahead. We are left with 11 games during which anything can happen. We respect every team in the division including our next opponents, Stellenbosch. It is not going to be easy but we will do our best, hopefully we will put all the maximum points in the bag, Ramunenyiwa said. He also thanked their supporters for keeping the team in their prayers in all the matches. We asked them to pray for us and they are doing that. They are always at our matches and we thank them for that. We will take every match as it comes and we will continue working hard, Ramunenyiwa explained. Asked about widely reported apparent interest shown in the services of Leopards star defender Lebogang Mabotja by Premier Soccer League clubs he said he was unaware thereof. Mabotja joined Leopards in 2013 from Roses United and has been instrumental in the club s quest for PSL status. We are not aware of any interest of our player. We have not received anything formal and we are open for negotiations, Ramunenyiwa said. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert@mailbox.co.za &nbsp;
