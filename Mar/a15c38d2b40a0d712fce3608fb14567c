Lucas Peter Sinclair, a local bishop, appeared in the Polokwane Magistrate s Court on charges of assault, sexual assault and attempt to commit sexual assault on Friday after which the case was postponed to 20 March. It is believed that trial has started and that two witnesses testified during the court proceedings. Sinclair who was arrested in February last year faces three charges of assault, four of sexual assault and two of attempt to commit sexual assault involving nine victims. During his first appearance, Sinclair collapsed in the dock. Presiding Officer Joe Abrahams then, before postponing the case for bail application, ordered that the accused be taken to hospital and examined. Sinclair was granted R5 000 bail on condition that he does not interfere with any of the witnesses and complainants. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
