Local fencer Michelle Butler, 15, recently qualified to represent South Africa at the Junior and Cadet World Championships in Bulgaria at the beginning of next month. She will however need financial assistance to make the biggest dream of her young life come true. Michelle is a member of the Firebird Fencing Club and one of only three who competed at the recent National Junior Fencing Finals in Soweto where they were selected for the team that will compete in Plovdiv, Bulgaria from 1 to 10 April. Michelle has done fencing for nearly two years now and is doing exceptionally well. The whole package to participate in Bulgaria costs about R50 000. We have already received generous donations but Michelle still needs some spending money for food and drinks abroad and any assistance will be appreciated, Michelle s mother, Malanie said. Michelle s fencing record is evidence of a hard working fencer with passion for the sport. Since the 2015/16 season has she collected several gold, silver and bronze medals on both provincial and national level. The team is set to leave from OR Tambo International Airport on 29 March and those willing to make donations can call Melanie on 079 141 8848. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com &nbsp;
