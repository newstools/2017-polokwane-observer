The first Polokwane Oval Club Championship of the year promises to be bigger and even better than before with not only Bosveld Wedrenklub from Mokopane participating but some Sprints drivers from Johannesburg also to join in the race on 25 March. Adding to the fun will be the presence of the Cooper Drifting Team from Mokopane. This will also be the opportunity for Elsie and Douw de Beer to claim their prize in Polo kwane Observer s Valentine s Day competition held in conjunction with Polokwane Oval last month. They will enjoy an in-car experience with one of the drifters. Polokwane Oval Secretary Janine van Breda said the event is be something not to be missed. The spectators really have a good time during our events. They bring their own braais and create a pleasant atmosphere while enjoying the adrenaline rushing action on the raceway, Van Breda said. Children will also be entertained and food stalls and a bar are available. Gates open at 12:00 with the formal programme commencing at 18:00. The club championship is a test run for the annual Polokwane Oval Winter Trophy to be hosted on 27 Mei. Van Breda added that Polokwane Oval decided rather than handing trophies to podium winners they would instead receive a hamper containing shopping vouchers and other products from the main sponsors, Goldwagen and Fast Tools.
