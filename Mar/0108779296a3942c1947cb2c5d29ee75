For the first time ever, the famous Mall of the North Marathon that will take place on 1 April will accommodate wheelchair athletes. Residents are urged to spread the word and encourage all wheelchair athletes to take part in this amazing event. We don t have many wheelchair entries yet and would really love for this marathon to be inclusive and accessible for all, says Colinda Potgieter, chairperson of Pietersburg Road Runners (PRR) and race organiser. Wheelchair athletes are welcome to enter in the 5 km, 10 km and 21,1 km races and there is also an option for runners to push people in wheelchairs, but they will not be eligible for any prizes. The prize money for the first female and male wheelchair athletes to finish the 21,1 km is R500. The first male and female wheelchair athletes in the 10 km will receive R300 and the winners of the 5 km (male and female) will receive R100 each. The race starts and ends at the overflow parking area at Mall of the North and wheelchair athletes have their own starting times. Entries can be done at the Mall of the North help desk opposite the Game entrance until Friday (tomorrow). Athletes are also welcome to register from 04:00 to 05:45 on Saturday at the starting point at Mall of the North. Registration costs R100 for the half marathon, R80 for the 10 km and R40 for the fun run. Temporary licenses are available at R30 each.
