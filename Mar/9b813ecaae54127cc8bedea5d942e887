Mall of the North shoppers interested in buying or selling a property had the opportunity to make valuable connections with estate agents at RE/MAX Northland Realty s monthly exhibition. RE/MAX Northland Realty has run an exhibition every last weekend of each month for the past year at Mall of the North to make the properties and services that they offer more accessible to their clients and potential clients. The display gives the public a chance to find out which services the agency offers, what properties are for sale and how to find the perfect property. Agents are on hand to discuss options and give advice where needed. Located at Game Court in Mall of the North, the exhibition is in a high foot traffic area, ensuring that RE/MAX Northland Realty receives maximum exposure.
