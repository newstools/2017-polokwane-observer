Local biker Mariaan Coetzee invites all interested female bikers to contact her in order to finalise preparations for the annual International Female Ride Day (IFRD) on 6 May. This year marks the 11th international, fifth national and second provincial hosting of the event. IFRD is a campaign for women motorcycle riders that aims to highlight and profile the countless number of woman riders enjoying the sport and, for the first time, local bikers are planning to conduct mass ride. It is an all brands, all forms and all styles worldwide ride. All riders are invited to participate and join in on the universal ride day action themed Just Ride, Coetzee said. Coetzee, provincial representative of Lady Bikers South Africa, an agent for IFRD, added that this year s ride will take participants across the Soutpansberg all the way to Musina. Riders can stop at the scenic HF Verwoerd Tunnels while food and refreshments will be enjoyed in the border town. The message we want to bring forward during the ride day is: We are bikers, but still women. We wear leathers and boots, but also heels, make-up and bling, Coetzee said. There are no registration costs involved but bikers are expect to pay for their own fuel, toll fees, food and drinks. Riders interested can contact Coetzee on 084 620 2550 or email mariaancoetzee@gmail.com. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com &nbsp;
