The levels of the four water reservoirs which supply the major portion of the city has dropped drastically and Polokwane Municipality has urged consumers to limit usage and use water for domestic use only.
Communications and Marketing Manager of the municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo confirmed this morning (Tuesday) that the level of the Potgieter Avenue reservoir is at 63%, opposed to the usual level of around 90%. The levels of the 50 and 30 megalitre reservoirs next to Ster Park are at 15% and 5% respectively, while the old 30 megalitre reservoir’s level is at 4%.
“Bendor and other high lying areas like Ster Park, Serala View and Flora Park will experience water shortages. Water tankers are dispatched to the affected areas and more tankers are on standby to provide relief where necessary,” Mothapo advised.
Mothapo attributed the low reservoir levels to the high temperatures that were experienced over the last few days, resulting in an increase of usage and higher evaporation. “All systems are running,” he confirmed and advised consumers requiring water tankers to call the municipality on 015 290 2376 or 015 290 2629.
