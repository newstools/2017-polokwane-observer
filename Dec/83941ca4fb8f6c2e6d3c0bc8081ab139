Karate warriors from the Henri Eksteen Honbu Dojo in the city and as far as North West province took to the tatami mat battlefield and displayed fearsome skills in both Kata and Kumite techniques which kept the spectators glued to their seats during the 13th Invitational All Styles Eksteen Bushido Freestyle Karate tournament recently.
According to Soke Henri Eksteen 10th Dan, owner and chief organiser of the event, the tourney was one of the best championhips he has hosted to date within the Battle in the Bush National invitational all styles contact karate championship series. He said the tournament attracted 70 karatekas and they all did exceptionally well with participants receiving medals.
He thanked all the table officials, medical crew, referees, judges, all karatekas, parents as well as all spectators for making the day a huge success. Eksteen’s warriors will now prepare themselves for the forthcoming Limpopo Karate Federation – Karate South Africa provincial trials scheduled to take place somewhere in February.
