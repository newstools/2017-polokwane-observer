The African National Congress (ANC) Limpopo’s Special Provincial General Council is expected to commence at a venue in Polokwane within the next hour.
Delegates from branches across the province are due to, among others, nominate names for leadership positions to be elected at the party’s National Elective Conference in Gauteng late this month.
