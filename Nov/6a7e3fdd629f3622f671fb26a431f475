Black Leopards Football Club’s 2-0 victory against Mthatha Bucks at Thohoyandou Stadium last Saturday will prompt them to do well in other matches of the National First Division (NFD). This is the opinion of Tshifiwa Thidiela, Managing Director of the club.
The feat sees them moving from a precarious 13th to more stable 10th position with 19 matches in hand.
This was the team’s fourth victory of the season since August and it will be celebrated by all their supporters. “That was one of our massive victories of the season and it will spur us on. We did not start the season well. We are in the fixing process and we are still on course for the automatic promotion. The difference between us and team on top is nine points which we can get in three matches. So, every match we play we want to win and we are adamant that we can win the division. We have got a new coach in Ivan Minnaert who is doing well and has also shown that he wants to be part of Black Leopards Football Club,” Thidiela said.
He also mentioned that they were hoping for other maximum points against Super Eagles Football Club when the two meet at Goble Park Stadium in Free State on Saturday. “We don’t know anything about them besides the fact they were promoted to the division from ABC Motsepe League in July. We don’t know to expect from them but we are not worried. We will give our best performance of the day and come back home with three points,” Thidiela assured.
