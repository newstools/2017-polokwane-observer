Police have launched a manhunt for three suspects responsible for the death of 60-year-old Christo Redelinghuys during an alleged farm attack outside Hoedspruit last night (Sunday).
Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that the incident happened at approximately 20:30. It is alleged that Redelinghuys and his daughter went outside to lock the gate and when they returned they noticed three armed suspects next to the house. When the farmer questioned their presence they allegedly opened fire without saying a word.
Redelinghuys was fatally wounded and his daughter escaped unharmed.
Police responded swiftly when they received the call and the manhunt was immediately launched.
Ngoepe said the motive behind the killing was not clear yet as there was no indication that any items were stolen from the house.
Anyone with information can dial the crime stop number 08600 10111 or report to the nearest Police station.
