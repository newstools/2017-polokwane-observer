Rameez Patel who is standing trial on a charge of killing his wife Fatima, briefly appeared in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court this morning (Monday) following his arrest on Friday on a second charge of murder, that of his mother, Mahjebeen Patel.
The case was postponed to next week for bail application and Patel, who will remain in custody, was escorted to the Limpopo High Court where the trial in the first case is continuing.
Patel’s mother was shot and killed in her home in Nirvana about two weeks ago. During his appearance in the Polokwane High Court last week it was learnt that Patel’s cell phone had been confiscated during the investigation into the death of Mahjebeen.
Court proceedings are expected to start soon.
