Murder accused Rameez Patel and his lawyer, Tumi Mokwena are expected to consult for the rest of the day to prepare for his trial in the murder case of Patel’s wife, Fatima that is scheduled to continue in the Limpopo High Court tomorrow (Tuesday).
Judge Joseph Raulinga granted Mokwena the rest of the day to consult with his client after he brought an application for postponement before court this morning (Monday). Mokoena indicated that neither sufficient time nor suitable facilities existed at the Polokwane Police holding cells to consult with his client following his arrest on Friday on a second charge of murder, that of his mother Mahjebeen about two weeks ago.
Patel was earlier today (Monday) remanded in custody and will appear again in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court next week for a bail application on the second murder charge.
Patel’s arrest followed shortly after his cell phone was confiscated during investigations into the alleged cold blooded murder of his mother.
