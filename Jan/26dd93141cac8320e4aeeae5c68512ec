In their quest to avoid relegation in the Premier Soccer League (PSL), Baroka Football Club in December appointed former Mpumalanga Black Aces Coach Mark Harrison as its technical director. Since their promotion to the elite league in May, the Seleteng based outfit has amassed a mere 12 points from 15 matches and are lying currently in position 16 of the league. Spokesperson Jimmy Ngobeni said they were fortunate to have Harrison on board because his expertise is expected to help them evade relegation and finish the league in a better position. We are presently not in a good position and we can t afford to be relegated. He is a well experienced coach and we believe he will work well with the Head Coach Kgoloko Thobejene to take the team to its rightful position, Ngobeni said. He also confirmed that former Highlands Park midfielder Jose Garcia, Helder Pelembe formerly with Bloemfontein Celtic and Siphamandla Sangweni from Orlando Pirates were signed in December. We did not do well in the first round of the league and we saw a need to strengthen the team. We are not done with signing players, we will be signing more during the January window period, Ngobeni said. Baroka will resume their fight for survival against Chippa United when the two meet in Port Elizabeth on 8 February after the African Cup of Nations tournament which commences in Gabon this weekend. They beat us 4-1 in the first round of the league and we can t afford to lose to them again. We are well prepared and we are confident that we will walk away as victors, Ngobeni said.
