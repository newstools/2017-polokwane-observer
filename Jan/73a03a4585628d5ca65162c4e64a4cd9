Following their dismal performance in the first round of the National First Division (NFD), Magesi Football Club has vowed to do better when the season re-opens in February after the African Cup of Nations Tournament. The Moletji based team found themselves in the last position the Division with 11 points after 15 matches, which is worrying factor for their supporters. Since their promotion to the Division from the ABC Motsepe League in May, they have only won against Amazulu at old Peter Mokaba Stadium in November last year. Club Chief Executive Officer, John Mathibe has promised the soccer loving people of the province and Magesi supporters that they won get relegated. We have talented players and we are playing well, it is just that we are unable to convert our chances. We are also competing against experienced teams that have been in the division for years. However, we are confident that we will do well in the last remaining matches. The thing about our position in the division is that we have a lot to worry about, we have to work hard and not much is expected from us, Mathibe said.
