Petrol heads can look forward to much action and drama during the first racing event of the year when Polokwane Oval hosts the second leg of the United States of America (USA) vs. South Africa Invitational Teams Challenge on Saturday, 28 January. Polokwane Oval Secretary Janine van Breda said the programme holds not only adrenaline rushing action but some awesome surprises for fans and spectators. Sixteen top sprint car drivers of which six are from the USA will battle it out on the race track. Close to 16 000 horsepower on a 400 m race track at once is surely an event not to be missed, she said. She added that for the first time in Polo kwane Oval history the event will be recorded and broadcast on Ignition TV DStv channel 189. The broadcasting date will be available later. Big names in the USA invitational team such as Brian Lay, Jimmy McCune, Jimi Swain, Bill Tyler and two new comers Troy de Caire and Mike Stutsman will be seen in action. The team also brings along their own, well known oval racing commentator Tom Hartsell. The first leg of the challenge will be hosted on 21 January in Vereeniging followed by the finals on 4 February at the same venue. Entry fees for the race at Polokwane Oval are R100 per adult and R50 for children older than 12 years. Children under 12 are free. Gates open at 10:00 with the race expecting to start at 16:00.
