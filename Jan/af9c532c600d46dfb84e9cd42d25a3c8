The first oval race will be held at Polokwane Oval when the city will host the second leg of the United States of America (USA) vs. South Africa Invitational Teams Challenge on Saturday. This event is not to be missed as the race promises some awesome surprises for fans and spectators. Some big names from the USA invitational team in the Sprints seat such as Brian Lay, Jimmy McCune, Jimi Swain, Bill Tyler and two new comers Troy de Caire and Mike Stutsman will be seen in action. Polokwane Oval Secretary Janine van Breda said sixteen top sprint car drivers of which six are from the USA will battle it out on the race track. Close to 16 000 horsepower on a 400 m race track at once is surely a thrilling event and one of biggest ever held in Polokwane. Van Breda added that first time in Polokwane Oval history the event will be recorded and broadcast on Ignition TV DStv channel 189. The broadcasting date will be available later. The USA invitational team also brings along their own well known oval racing commentator Tom Hartsell. The first leg of the challenge was hosted on Saturday in Vereeniging followed by the third and final round on 4 February at the same venue.
