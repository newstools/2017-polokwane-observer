The 2016 Queen of the North titleholders, in partnership with Limpopo Beauty Modelling Academy and main sponsor Modern Autohaus BMW, donated 80 stationery packs to children who are taken care of at Ga-Maboi Drop-in Centre in the Mankweng area. The beauties enjoyed meeting the kids and was overwhelmed by a song of gratitude sung by them. They motivated them and prompted them to look after the new stationery. Queen of the North 2016, Ronnel Homu, is quoted to have said it was a privilege to be part of the project and that one could see true appreciation on every little face. The children live in very poor conditions pageant director Katryn Barwise explained. At home many of these kids only receive one meal a day or sometimes none. They go to the drop-in centre after school where four carers cook lunch for them. The centre is in desperate need of more food supplies and any contribution is welcome.
