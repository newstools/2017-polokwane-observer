Polokwane City Football Club has acquired the services of former Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana midfielder Tlou Segolela on an 18 month contract. The Moletjie born midfielder joined the team in December from Platinum Stars who released him towards the end of the 2015/16 Premier Soccer League (PSL) season. Segolela also played for Bloemfontein Celtic and was the part of Orlando Pirates team which won double-treble titles in 2010/11 and 2011/12 PSL season which include two league titles. He also won the Premier Soccer League Goal of the Season Award in 2011 for the goal he scored against Free States Stars in the Botshabelo Stadium when he took the ball just inside his own half and without support from team mates. The goal has been likened to the one scored by Argentina s Diego Maradona in the 1986 Fifa World Cup Final in Mexico. Head Coach of the Club, Luc Eymael described Segolela as a good player who will add value to the team. He has been training with us for the past two months and I was impressed with him and his work ethic and that prompted us to sign him. We are confident that he will do well for the team.
