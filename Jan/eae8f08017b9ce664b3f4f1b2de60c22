Residents of Ster Park are up in arms about a house in Juno Street that is used to accommodate a large number of school children that are reportedly attached to a soccer academy in the city. This despite the fact that Polokwane Municipality took steps against the owner of the premises during November last year. Polokwane Observer also reported on the matter in November and stated that it was possibly a contravention of the applicable by-laws and the municipality s Town Planning Scheme. On Tuesday it was positively established that the children are still on the premises. When the matter was raised with the municipality in November acting Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality Matshidiso Mothapo confirmed that upon receipt of the complaint, an inspection of the premises was carried out which revealed that the house was overcrowded with young recruits of the soccer academy. The owner was contacted and he agreed to move or reduce the number of children in the house and to abate any health nuisance created. He was advised to contact the Town Planning Strategic Business Unit (SBU). Follow up inspections will be continuously conducted on the property, Mothapo confirmed. It now appears that, despite the undertaking from the municipality to act, the situation reamins unchanged The complaint was again brought to the attention of the municipality and yesterday (Wednesday) Mothapo promised to engage officials from the municipality s Land Use Management Section to investigate the matter and issue a notice to the owner. Mothapo also urged residents to report issues of this nature to the municipality.
