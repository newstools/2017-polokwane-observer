The suspect in an alleged human trafficking case, Raymond Sithole briefly appeared in the Seshego Magistrate s Court on Monday after he was arrested last week. He will appear in court again next Thursday. Limpopo Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke said four Zimbabwean nationals aged 15 to 20, were rescued during the arrest. The Hawks received information about Sithole who was allegedly holding four people under lock and key at a home in Chebeng Village outside Seshego. It is alleged that the victims were smuggled into the country with false promises of good jobs and better lives in South Africa, Maluleke said. The Hawks reacted swiftly on the information and made the arrest. It was also discovered that the victims were allegedly forced to steal and to work for Sithole without payment and brutally assaulted if they did not comply with his instructions, Maluleke informed. Hawks Head Thobeka Jozi commended the members who played a part in the success of the operation and warned suspects that Limpopo will not be the getaway for human trafficking and exploitation of the innocent and vulnerable. A 29-year-old suspect is expected to appear in the Musina Magistrate s Court today (Thursday) on a charge of corruption after being arrested at the Beitbridge border post last week. The Hawks responded quickly to information received about the suspect who had opened a so called one-stop shop where he reportedly stamped passports of foreign nationals at the Beitbridge taxi rank. According to Maluleke the Hawks confiscated, among other things, immigration stamps from the Department of Home Affairs and an undisclosed amount of money in American Dollar and Rand. It is not clear how long the suspect s illegal activities had been going on. It is believed that he was not working alone and more arrests might be made soon, Maluleke said.
