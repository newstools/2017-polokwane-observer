With only 15 matches to go before the current season of the National First Division ends, Black Leopards Football Club remains confident of their promotion to the Premier Soccer League (PSL). Lidoda Duvha currently lies in eighth position of the division with 21 points and Club Spokesperson Berry Ramunenyiwa is certain that they will win all the remaining matches. We are in this division to compete and we don t want to lose any match. We are aiming for automatic promotion to the league and if we don t get it we will have to go through the promotional play-offs, he explained. He also stated that the Festive Season and African Cup of Nations break was a blessing in disguise as it gave their new Coach, Francois Luscuito time to bond with the players and acquaint them with his coaching philosophy. We really needed that kind of a break. We appointed him November and he has settled well, the players understand him and the team is even stronger than before, Ramunenyiwa said. They will be hoping for maximum points when they face 13th placed Milano United at Blue Downs Stadium in Cape Town on 12 February. Milano is a good, tough team but they have never given us problems. We have both lost and won against them on occasions. We can t afford to lose against them now. We have a strong squad and we believe they will win the match, Ramunenyiwa said.
