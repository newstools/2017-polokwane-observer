A group of disgruntled ANC Youth Leaguers (Ancyl) in Limpopo is reportedly preparing for their own Provincial General Council (PGC) in Polokwane next week with the aim of not only raising issues of concern but passing a motion of no confidence in the provincial executive of the Ancyl. Boy Mamabolo, an ANC branch leader who is convenor of the group of a reported 2 000 young cadres from across the province, claimed that those to attend would be members attached to all regions and branches of the youth league in Limpopo. It was learnt that they were expected to gather at an undisclosed venue to stage their own PGC as the current Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) of the Ancyl has not convened any meeting to debate the issues of the youth since their inception in 2015. The venue for the meeting was not being made public as yet to avoid the programme being disrupted, Mamabolo said. Matome Moremi on behalf of the Ancyl PEC said Mamabolo couldn t call a PGC for he wasn t an Ancyl member. He referred to Mamabolo going around insulting individuals and said we ve got no time for lunatics like Boy Mamabolo . Moremi was of the opinion that it was a strategy to distract the youth league in the province from their call for ANC Provincial Chairperson Stan Mathabatha to concentrate on an agenda of issues on youth development. Currently their focus was also on Absa to pay back reported apartheid-era bailout billions to be re-channelled towards development and free education, he continued. He called on Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba to attend to the mental health of Mamabolo as a matter of urgency for injuries sustained in a shooting in the past seemingly impacted on his actions.
