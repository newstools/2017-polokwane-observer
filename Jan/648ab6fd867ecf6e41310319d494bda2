Baroka Football Club shocked many football supporters when they terminated the contract of crowd favourites Tshepo Matete, Loyiso Simandla, Khalid Aucho and Uganda national team captain Geoffrey Massa last week. Massa, currently in Gabon for the African Cup of Nations Tournament, joined the club at the beginning of the season from Bloemfontein Celtic. Matete who was named Sport Personality of the Year at the Fame SA Awards joined the club in January last year after he was spotted at the annual Maimane Phiri Games in Soweto. Simandla has been with the Club since 2015 while Aucho joined the club last year. We are busy restructuring the team. We did not do well in the first phase of the season and as per the club s technical report they don t fit in our plans for the next phase and beyond. Everything was done for the sake of the team and we are hoping to do well in the second phase of the season, Club Spokesperson, Jimmy Ngobeni said. He also confirmed that they signed Botswana international and Gaborone United midfielder Mpho Kgaswane last week. There is nothing extraordinary about him but he is an exciting player and we are confident that he will do well for the team, Ngobeni said.
