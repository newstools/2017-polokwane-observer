Naledzani Rasila, Head of Communications of the Department of Education earlier this week informed that a vacant building at Tom Naud Technical High School will be used by the Polokwane circuit to temporarily accommodate learners in the Foundation Phase that could not be admitted by other schools in the circuit. The total number of learners who will be accommodated at the temporary school is not available yet, as parents were still streaming to the circuit offices by the time of going to print. Rasila said some learners could not be placed as their parents moved or were newly appointed to Polokwane, but many parents also did not heed calls to register their children in time last year. Polokwane Observer ascertained that many schools were still swamped by requests for admission. One newly established private school was sent more than 30 Grade 1 learners by another private school which could not accommodate them as the school was full. The principal of the school said they have space to erect more temporary classrooms, which could be done within the next two weeks. Rasila could not confirm when construction will commence, but said one new school is being planned for Bendor.
