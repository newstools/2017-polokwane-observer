The personal belongings of a former attorney Stanley Malatji were seized on Friday after the Limpopo High Court ordered to attach his assets following an application by the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in Polokwane for a provisional restraint order against him on 19 May. The seized property is estimated to be worth R2,5 million. NPA s Regional Spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said Malatji used to be an attorney and a director of a Tzaneen law firm named Malatji Attorneys. He was struck from the roll of attorneys by the High Court in Pretoria in February 2013 and also arrested on charges of theft and various contraventions of the Attorneys Act. The charges stem from offences committed from April 2007 to October 2011, Malabi-Dzhangi said. It is alleged that Malatji claimed money from the Road Accident Fund (RAF) on behalf of his clients. As soon as the money had been paid into the firm s account he then allegedly withdrew it for personal use and did not pay it to his clients, Malabi-Dzhangi added. Malatji last appeared in court on 12 April and will appear again on 11 October for criminal trial in the Tzaneen Magistrate s Court. The property currently in the possession of the curator includes immovable property and household contents at his house in Tzaneen, household contents at his current residence in Pretoria North, other movable property comprising of a KIA K2700 half-truck and three trailers as well as an Absa trust account. Various other personal bank accounts were also frozen, according to Malabi-Dzhangi. The NPA welcomed the restraint order and Director of Public Prosecutions Ivy Thenga was quoted to have said that AFU remains an effective law enforcement mechanism to ensure that no person should benefit from crime and to ensure that crime does not pay. She reportedly also commended the excellent co-operation between the NPA and other law enforcement agencies. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
