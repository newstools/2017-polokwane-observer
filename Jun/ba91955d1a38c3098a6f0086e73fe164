Polokwane Police Spokesperson Lesiba Ramoshaba said a case of business robbery is being investigated. He explained that two men entered the jewellery shop just before closing time. The one allegedly asked a shop assistant which the most expensive items of jewellery in the shop were. Both suspects then showed the assistants pistols carried in their waists and ordered them to the back office, according to Ramoshaba. The suspects allegedly proceeded to put items of jewellery of an unknown value in a bag and left. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
