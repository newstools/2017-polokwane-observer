Spectators who attended the Limpopo Senior Hockey Tournament on the Ho rskool Pietersburg (PHS) Astro-field on Sunday were in for a spectacle as Polokwane Kings downed Phalaborwa Hockey Club and Polokwane Queens proved their sovereignty over Polokwane rivals The Duchess. The Kings overpowered the visitors from Phalaborwa with 2-0 while Unicorn Men s team exchanged blows with the Limpopo University Men s team to win 4-3. Unicorn Women s team won Levubu 3-1 and the highlight of the day was the local match up in which The Queens gave the Duchess a lesson in field hockey with a 5-0 victory.
