Local soccer star Tiyani Mabunda on Monday received the call that every soccer player waits for. Bafana Bafana Head Coach Stuart Baxter invited Mabunda to be part of the 25 man squad that will face Nigeria in a 2019 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier match at Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, Nigeria on Saturday. The Polokwane born midfielder was part of the national team that beat Senegal 2-1 last year at Peter Mokaba Stadium and he replaces his injured teammate at Mamelodi Sundowns Football Club Hlompho Kekana. Mabunda had an amazing season with Mamelodi Sundowns helping them to win the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Champions League and Supers Cup. He started playing football at Pietersburg Comprehensive School, continued to Flora Park Comprehensive High Schools and was later snatched up by Black Leopards Football Club in 2010. He joined Sundowns ahead of the 2013/14 and has also helped them to win the Premier Soccer League title in the 2014 and 2016 seasons. He has also established Tiyani Mabunda Foundation where he stages soccer tournaments in Polokwane and surrounds with the aim of giving aspiring young soccer players a platform to showcase their talent. It is honour to be part of the national team and I am looking forward to do my best and help the team to qualify for Afcon because it s been long since we played in the tournament, Mabunda said.
