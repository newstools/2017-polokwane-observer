Masilo Rufus Ramalapa who was arrested by Limpopo Hawks on charges of fraud and corruption on Friday is expected back in the Polokwa ne Magistrate s Court tomorrow (Friday) for a formal bail application. The Hawks arrested Ramalapa after apparently receiving a tipoff. Hawks Spokesperson Matimba Maluleke said Ramalapa who allegedly claimed to be an official from the Department of Education demanded R150 000 bribe from the complainant in order to award a tender issued by the department to provide security services to special schools and the offices of the department. The complainant reported the matter to the Hawks who subsequently set a trap which led to the arrest. Preliminary investigation revealed that the tender documents given to the complainant by the suspect were actually fraudulent, Maluleke said. Department of Education Communications Manager Naledzani Rasila confirmed that Rama lopa is not employed by the department.
