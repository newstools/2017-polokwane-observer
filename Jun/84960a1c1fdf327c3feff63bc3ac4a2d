High school learners from Mmotong wa Perekisi, Seshego, Ga Maraba village and Chebeng were exposed to various career options and professions during the Touch Lives Organisation s career day held at Mosamaria Community Church in Chebeng on Youth Day. This also gave Grade 12 students from schools in the areas an opportunity to interact with each other and exchange ideas about career options. Executive member of the organisation and congregant, Lerato Ramatla said they wanted to reach out to students from disadvantaged areas and help them to access information about their careers of choice. We have noticed that most of them are already in high school and they don t know which career paths they will be venturing into. Most of them are from far-flung areas and some are unable to access information about tertiary institutions. We invited representatives from Rosebank College in Polokwane and Tshwane University of Technology to share insight about different careers on offer at the institutions. They also came with application forms for those who are interested to study with them, Ramatla said. Participating learner Edwina Matlou described the event as an eye-opener and thanked the church for organising the event. It was exactly what we needed especially this time of the year because most of us don t know which career path to follow. The event also served to motivate other learners because there are marks that they have to acquire to qualify for those courses. They now understand the responsibility ahead and the hard work they have to put in in order for them to achieve their future goals, Matlou said.
