One of the major attractions for residents and visitors to the Polokwane Game Reserve will for a while not be available for viewing since the eight surviving rhinos were recently relocated to a more secure sanctuary somewhere in the province. The municipality s Communications and Marketing Manager, Matshidiso Mothapo said that he is, for security reasons, not at liberty to disclose where the rhinos are now kept but confirmed that the relocation of the rhinos is a temporary arrangement. The municipality has budgeted R3 mil lion for security measures at the Game Reserve for the 2017/18 financial year. It would cost no more that R500 000 for the relocation and accommodation of the animals, Mothapo said. During the last two years, four rhinos were poached and their horns removed by poachers and a further one seriously injured in incidents in the reserve. Security was thereafter stepped up, resulting in very high expenditure. The municipality could not provide the amount that are spent annually to protect the animals because the services provided to safeguard municipal assets are not quantified per asset. Instances where other precious natural assets such as lions were killed and their paws and heads removed to be used for medicinal purposes made headlines in the media and the police have recently arrested a number of poachers that were apprehended after killings that took place on game farms in the province.
