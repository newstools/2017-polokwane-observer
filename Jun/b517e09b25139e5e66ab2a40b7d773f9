No arrests have been made as yet after a massive manhunt was launched for a group of armed suspects who allegedly bombed and robbed a cash-in-transit vehicle on the Leeudraai road between Ga-Kgapane and Modjadjiskloof last Thursday evening. According to Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe it was alleged that a cash-in-transit vehicle had been attacked and bombed with explosives before an undisclosed amount of money was robbed en route to Modjadjis kloof. Ngoepe said that during the incident the driver and his two crew members had sustained serious injuries and were taken to hospital for medical treatment. When asked for clarification he said the three men had been shot in the process. The suspects apparently used a white BMW and a Toyota Fortuner with unknown registration numbers during the attack, it was learnt. Ngoepe indicated that it was not clear how many suspects were involved in the execution of the crime. Anyone with information is requested to contact Police official William Ramokhubedu on 082 499 8389, the nearest Police station, the Crime Stop number on 0860 010 111 or the crime line on 32211.
