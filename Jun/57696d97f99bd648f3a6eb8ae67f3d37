Proving that age is just a number, 54-year-old Henri Eksteen, Founder of Henri Eksteen Fight Club, claimed two first places during the second annual Honbu Championships Preliminary trials hosted by the Eksteen Bushido Freestyle Karate do Institute on Saturday. The event was held to prepare the athletes for the upcoming 13th Annual Invitational South African All Styles Battle in the Bush Championships series scheduled for November and saw 65 athletes in all age groups demonstrating the results of months of training during the full contact fights. Eksteen explained that the Battle in the Bush event will host clubs from North-West, Gauteng and Mpumalanga and promises top class fighting from different disciplines, including kick-boxing. According to Eksteen, his institute is focused more on streetwise fighting with athletes wearing full safety gear, unlike other clubs that only allow semi-contact. He added that athletes who achieve first place in Kata or Kumite this year and do so again the following year will be awarded with Limpopo Karate colours by his organisation. He further stated that the day was a big success packed with action that entertained the ample crowd of parents, relatives and fellow karateka.
