A formal link between two of South Africa s best stage trail running races has been formed taking them to a new level. Both races start and finish in the province. The Wolkberg Trail Run goes to the highest point in the province known as Iron Crown during its first stage, while Kruger2Canyon climbs up the well-known Mariepskop and then down into the Blyde River Canyon. Other similarities between the events are that both start and finish at schools, consist of two stages, take place over long weekends and offer unique experiences running in otherwise inaccessible places. Craig Carolan, Headmaster of Stanford Lake College, and Andrew Booth, Director of KZN Trail Running are very excited by the direction in which the partnership will take trail running in Limpopo. Trail runners in Limpopo are widespread but here we have two great events coming together to offer a quality of trail running that can match up to virtually anywhere in the world. We are incredibly blessed with the options on our doorstep and the more we can work together to make great events happen the better, Carolan said. Booth backed this up: We are based in KZN but the opportunity to co-host the Kruger2Canyon Challenge with Carolan and Stanford Lake College arose and it was obvious that a partnership would enhance the race and what is has to offer. The venues are only a 1 hour drive from one another with the events taking place two months apart, the first being the Kruger2Canyon this weekend and the second the 2017 Wolkberg Trial Run on 12 and 13 August.
