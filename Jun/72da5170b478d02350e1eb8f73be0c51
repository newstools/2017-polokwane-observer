Baroka Football Club has, in an ongoing effort to sustain their Premier Soccer League status, released 13 players and appointed former Acornbush United Coach Macdonald Makhubedu as assistant to Kgoloko Thobejane last Friday. Mxolisi Kunene, Jacky Motshegwa, Siphamandla Sangweni, Tshepiso Lietsisa, Siphelele Zikalala, Helder Pelembe, Mdeni Zikalala, Magoro Letsoalo, Hunadi Nkoana, Caswell Chauke, Ndivhuwo Ravhuhali, Thapelo Maleka and Nkosinathi Ogle were released. Club Spokesperson Jimmy Ngobeni said the released players were deemed surplus to requirements by the technical team. This is part of restructuring the team and most of them were not playing either. They spent most of the time on the bench and we felt we should not waste their time and their talent. We wish them all the best in their future endeavours, Ngobeni said. He also stated that Makhubedu will fit well in the team having previously worked at Batau Football Club and Jomo Cosmos Football Club. He started working last week. We are currently holding trials all over the province and he is helping the technical team with those and we are looking forward to work with him in the new season, Ngobeni said.
