Limpopo Tourism Agency (LTA) gave disadvantaged fans of Baroka Football Club in Lepelle-Nkumpi an unexpected treat by providing them with transport to see their favourite team in action during their National First Division and Premier Soccer League (PSL) Playoffs match against Stellenbosch Football Club on Saturday. Six buses packed with supporters and students from Tlourwe High School, Kgwadi ya Moleke High School, SJ Van der Merwe High School, Ntwampe High School, Kgwaratlou High School and Thokgwa High School travelled to Peter Mokaba Stadium to watch their team take down the opponents 2-0. The gesture was part of LTA s commitment to heighten awareness about sport events among school children in an attempt to profile sport tourism in the province. LTA interim CEO, Bibi Kotsedi in a statement said they had seen an opportunity for underprivileged soccer fans and school children to experience a live game whilst they learn about the tourism offerings from destinations enroute to the Peter Mokaba Stadium precinct. Some of the key tourism attractions along the route included Chuene Resort, Bakone Malapa Northern Sotho Open-Air Museum and Polokwane Game Reserve. Mokgaetji Molaba, a learner from Kgwadi ya Moleke High School said: It was my first time at the stadium and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I have been to Polokwane before so I am familiar with some of the tourism attractions en route to Polokwane and the stadium. Credit should go to the agency for the opportunity and I think they should not only come with such initiatives for certain matches but in all fixtures, Molaba said.
