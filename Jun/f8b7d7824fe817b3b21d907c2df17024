The Central Business District of Polokwane was once again turned into a war zone when three people were attacked and seriously injured by a mob resulting in the death of one on the weekend. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the incident occurred on the corner of Rissik Street and Nelson Mandela Avenue when a group of people launched an attack on three individuals for a yet unknown reason. Police rescued the three victims from their attackers and they were taken to hospital where one later died from his injuries. The other two are still recuperating in hospital, Ngoepe said, adding that no arrest had been made yet. Meanwhile, Police have launched a manhunt for a group of suspects who allegedly assaulted and killed two people at Ga-Marishane village outside Nebo on the weekend. Ngoepe said the two victims were reportedly traced and then assaulted by community members. When Police arrived one was already dead and the second victim died on his way to hospital, according to Ngoepe who indicated that the motive behind the brutal killing is still unknown. No arrests have been made yet. Police arrested two suspects who will face charges of kidnapping and murder after a 28-year-old woman was allegedly kidnapped and severely assaulted by a group of community members at Botlokwa. Police summoned to the scene saved the woman and took her to hospital where she later expired from her injuries, Ngoepe said. The motive behind the killing is not known but preliminary investigation revealed that the female had earlier opened a case of malicious damage to property against members of the community. Acting Provincial Police Commissioner Jan Scheepers once again called on communities to refrain from taking the law into their own hands. Anyone with information on the incidents can contact Brig James Espach on 082 576 0743 or the nearest Police station. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
