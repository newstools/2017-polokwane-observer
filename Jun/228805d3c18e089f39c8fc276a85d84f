The Head Coach of Black Leopards Football Club, Jean Francois Lusciuto wants to be released from his position after failing to promote the Club to the Premier Soccer League (PSL). Leopards finished the National First Division (NFD) in the second position and were given a life line to compete for PSL status in the NFD and PSL Playoffs which they lost to Baroka Football Club at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. The Belgian-born mentor was appointed in November last year on a three-year deal, taking over from former Head Coach of Baroka Football Club Sello Chokoe. Black Leopards Finance Director Rendani Thidiela said Lusciuto asked the Chairperson of the club David Thidiela on Saturday after their match against Baroka to be released from his three year contract. He requested to see the Chairperson immediately after the match and asked to be released from his contract. We asked him to give us his request in black and white so that we can have a look at it and see what transpired. We haven t heard anything from him since Sunday but it looks like he has signed with the other team, Thidiela said. He further mentioned that the situation takes them back to the drawing and also put them in a difficult position ahead of the 2017/18 NFD season. Like I said it looks like he signed with the other team and if it is like that it will be difficult for us to find a coach soonest because we want someone who will start the team during the pre season preparations. We will also be having trails soon and we need a coach for that. NFD is more intense and tough so the sooner we resolve the coach issue the better, Thidiela remarked. By the time of going to press Lusciuto who won 11 out of 23 matches for Leopards could not be reached for a comment. Story and photo: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert.observer@gmail.com &nbsp;
