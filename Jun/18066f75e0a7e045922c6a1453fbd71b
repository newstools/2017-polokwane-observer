No arrest has been made yet in connection with an attempted cash-in-transit robbery on the R528 Georges Valley road on Monday morning. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said while the cash-in-transit vehicle was travelling between Haenertsburg and Tzaneen three vehicles reportedly tried to block it in and eventually forced the driver to stop. The suspects allegedly opened fire on the target vehicle causing security officers to retaliate from inside the vehicle. Some of the suspects allegedly sustained bullet wounds and were helped into the getaway vehicles by their accomplices before they left the scene, Ngoepe said. The suspects could not gain access to the money. The vehicles used by the suspects are alleged to be two Mercedes-Benz sedans, one black and the other white as well as a Toyota Quantum minibus with Gauteng registration. Anyone with information is requested to contact the investigating officer Captain Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or the nearest Police station.
