Vakhegula Vakhegula, the grannies soccer team from Nkowa-Nkowa managed to raise R2 500 during a teka soccer challenge they hosted in Polokwane on Sunday. The team will use the money for their trip to Mozambique in July where they will play in a friendly invitational match against a local grannies team. Event Organiser Nkhensani Ntsanwisi said they had partnered with a local restaurant which offered a special meal on the day and the profit made went to the team. They entertained the clientele with their soccer skills during the challenge and most of the people were excited so them in action. They enjoyed seeing them juggling the ball and it was fun. We had over 70 people who came to support the event and we thank them for their support, Ntsanwisi said. She said they needed R150 000 to ensure that the whole team could travel to Mozambique. We are taking the whole team of 15 players so we must raise sufficient funds to cover their transport and accommodation costs, Ntsanwisi said. This is not the first time the team will travel outside the country. In 2014 six members of the team travelled to Brazil to experience the Fifa World Cup. The trip was organised by Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa.
