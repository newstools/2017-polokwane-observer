The Auditor-General (AG), Kimi Makwetu, released the outcomes of the financial audits of the country s 263 municipalities and 51 municipal entities yesterday (Wednesday) and called for leadership accountability. Overall local government had failed to maintain the promising five year momentum gained in the years 2010-11 to 2014-15 that was reported last year, Makwetu said. Makwetu however said that Limpopo had, among others, shown momentum in the right direction. Improvements in Limpopo were as a result of increased focus to resolve audit findings in response to a strong stance taken by the Premier that steps will be taken against municipal managers if audit outcomes are poor. We commend the leadership for decisively acting on and implementing our previous years audit recommendations. We urge them to maintain this promising momentum, Makwetu said. A detailed analysis of the findings related to Limpopo municipalities will be published in Polokwane Observer next week. Story: BARRY VILJOEN &gt;&gt;barryv.observer@gmail.com
