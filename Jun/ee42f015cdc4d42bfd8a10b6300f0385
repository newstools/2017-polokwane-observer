Prominent local lawyer Tumi Mokwena who faces four charges of attempted murder was granted bail of R10 000 before the case was postponed on Tuesday to 25 August. Mokwena had to spend the weekend behind bars after the Lebowakgomo Magistrate s Court on Friday postponed the bail application to Tuesday. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the postponement. The case follows an alleged shooting incident at Zebediela Citrus Estate early last Thursday, reportedly leaving four people injured. Mokwena was traced and arrested at his office in Polokwane later the same day. A firearm was also confiscated. It is alleged that Mokwena had a meeting with some of the employees at the estate, during which conflict ensued and he subsequently produced a firearm and shot four of the employees before fleeing the scene in his vehicle, according to Ngoepe. The victims, one of them seriously injured, were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment after receiving first aid from a local clinic, Ngoepe said. He could not indicate if they have been discharged yet. Mokwena is known for representing stage personalities and has defended the likes of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Commander in Chief Julius Malema as well as local businessman Rameez Patel, accused of killing his wife in April 2015.
