Police are investigating a case of culpable homicide following the death of a migrant in an accident along the N1 North between Polokwane and Louis Trichardt. A Department of Home Affairs vehicle carrying seven migrants from Musina to Gauteng overturned and one person was killed at around midday last Wednesday. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said it is believed that the vehicle had a punctured tyre resulting in the driver losing control and the vehicle overturning. He could not provide the name of the deceased but confirmed him to be a 42-year-old male. The other occupants of the vehicle sustained serious injuries. Investigations continue.
