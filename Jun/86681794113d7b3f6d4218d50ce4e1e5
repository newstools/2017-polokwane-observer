While Baroka Football Club is still breathing a sigh of relief after retaining their Premier Soccer League (PSL) status, the club has undertaken to deliver a better performance in the 2017/18 season that is to resume in August. Baroka gave themselves another lifeline in the elite league by triumphing over Stellenbosch Football Club and Black Leopards Football Club during the recent National First Division and PSL Promotional Playoffs. Club Spokesperson Jimmy Ngobeni admitted that it had been a tough debut season for them in the PSL with lots of lessons learned along the way. It was tough, honestly we finished in 15th position and had to fight for PSL status in the playoffs. We are relieved to have won them. It was an orientation season for us and difficult for the players to adjust. We were not prepared for the league but we know what to expect now, Ngobeni said. He promised their supporters a different Baroka team when the season reopens. We know what kind of players we should sign and we can assure our supporters that we will assemble a strong team that competes for major titles in the league and ensure that we finish the league in a respectable position, Ngobeni added. Asked if Kgoloko Thobejane will remain Head Coach next season Ngobeni said he will continue with the team until further notice. We are happy with him. He saved us from relegation. Since he took over from Milton Dlamini we won two matches of the playoffs and drew two and now we are back in the PSL, so I don t see any reason why we should not retain his services, Ngobeni said.
