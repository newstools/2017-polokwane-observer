Baroka Football Club on Tuesday suspended their co-coach Milton Dlamini with immediate effect after he was appointed in March to work with Kgoloko Thobejane. Formerly with Mbombela United Football Club and the newly crowned National First Division (NFD) Champions Thanda Zulu Royals Dlamini had signed a short-term contract with the team with an option to renew and was in charge of the team in their last 13 matches of the Premier Soccer League. Club Spokesperson Jimmy Ngobeni confirmed Dlamini s suspension and also pointed out he won t be on the bench when they play against Stellenbosch Football Club in the NFD and Premier Soccer League promotional play-offs match at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. He will not even be part of the training. We can t tell you the reasons why we suspended him, it is an internal issue. Kgoloko Thobejane will be in charge of the team for the last remaining matches of the playoffs, Ngobeni said. Dlamini is the second coach to be suspended by the Ga-Mphahlele outfit after Jacob Sakala who was suspended in February this year, a mere month after his appointment in January.
