Not only did Jabez Christian Academy host the annual Limpopo Majorette and Cheerleading Association (Limca) Provincial Championships at Ho r Tegniese Skool Tom Naud last Saturday, but also saw both their teams emerging in the first and third positions respectively in the category in which they competed. Jabez Revelations team was the winners and the Chronicles team came third in the Pom/Non Prop Group Primary President s Category, being quite a distinction for the school in their first ever involvement in the competition. More than 800 team members from 14 schools over the province entertained spectators to top-class performances by majorettes and cheerleaders that executed their moves with military precision. School teams from as far as Lephalale and Musina took part, with SJ van der Merwe Technical High School from Lebowakgomo bringing a group of 104 contestants to showcase their skills. Jabez Christian Academy Principal, Elana Erasmus said that she was very proud of her teams. They all received medals and the school received a certificate. We will be back next year with a bigger team competing in all 15 categories. This will allow us to qualify to take part in the national championships, Erasmus said.
