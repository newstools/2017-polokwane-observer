Limpopo Baobabs finished the 2017 Brutal Fruit Netball Premier League in 8th position after losing 40-55 to Kingdom Stars in their 7th and 8th position playoff in Bloemfontein on Sunday. Baobabs came into the match buoyed by their 50-47 victory over the Mpumalanga Sunbirds on Saturday but the Stars were just too good for the Limpopo team. Although Baobabs led for most of the match, Sunbirds won the second and final quarters. In the dying minutes of the match, the Baobabs tossed the ball around to prevent the Sunbirds from scoring. Baobabs Head Coach, Dumisani Chauke reportedly said they were happy with the strides they had made in this year s campaign. It is a huge improvement for us and we have also improved our position. We finished last in previous seasons and we are looking to forward to the next season, she said. Story: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert.observer@gmail.com &nbsp;
