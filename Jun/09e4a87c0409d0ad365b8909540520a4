Community members of Ga-Mothapo outside Mankweng allegedly set several houses alight and further looted a number of spaza shops in the area after a young man was killed at a tavern on Monday evening. Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe indicated that four suspects have already been arrested and expected to appear in the Mankweng Magistrate s Court soon. Ngoepe said that a young man was allegedly stabbed to death by a group of men at a tavern. He was taken to hospital where he later died resulting in community members going on a rampage in search for the suspects &#8211; torching houses and looting several spaza shops, according to Ngoepe. He said Police reacted quickly and made four arrests. Police were also pelted with stones but community members were dispersed. The situation was calm and Police were still monitoring the area, Ngoepe indicated on Tuesday. In a separate incident unrest among community members in Aganang was reported on the weekend. Ngoepe confirmed the unrest but could not provide further detail. Acting Provincial Police Commissioner Jan Scheepers has echoed his discontent and disappointment on the continuous unbecoming actions of some community members in certain parts of the province by taking the law into their own hands. Scheepers warned that members who are caught practising the unlawful acts will be dealt with mercilessly. Story: RC Myburgh &gt;&gt;rc.observer@gmail.com
