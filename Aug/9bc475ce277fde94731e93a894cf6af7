Polokwane City Football Club caused a major upset in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) by beating Confederations of African Football champions Mamelodi Sundowns 2-1 at Loftus Stadium last night (Tuesday) thereby moving up to second position of the league. Sundowns came into the match buoyed by their 2-0 victory against Super Sport United on Saturday and City wanted redeem their from their last week s 0-0 draw against Baroka Football Club. Bernard Molekwa, Head Coach of Polokwane City said the match was not easy given the profile of Sundowns. Sundowns is very good team with quality players. I told the players to organise themselves and manage the distance well and they followed instructions. It was our first three points of the season and it was important for us to collect points early in the season because it is going to be a difficult road ahead, Molekwa said. Meanwhile, Head Coach of Baroka Football Club, Kgoloko Thobejane also heaped praise on his players for showing character against the mighty Orlando Pirates during the 1-1 draw at Peter Mokaba Stadium last night. Boroka has never lost to Pirates in a PSL fixture. All their home and away fixtures last season ended up in draws. We were hoping to break that duck but it was not to be. I am happy with the team, the boys showed character and the desire especially in the second half. We brought our recruit, Siphelele Ntshangase in the second half and we were able to create more chances. We could have scored in the last remaining matches of the league but we could not convert the chances we created, Thobejane said. Letladi Madubanya was named Man of the Match. Pirates goal was scored by Thabo Qalinge while Tanzanian Tanzian defender, Abdi Banda converted for Baroka. Story and photo: Herbert Rachuene &gt;&gt;herbert.observer@gmail.com &nbsp;
