The new 500 mm main water pipeline that runs along Devenish Street will be connected to the system tomorrow (Friday) evening, starting at 16:00 and will affect water supply to the Central Business District, Nirvana, Rainbow Park, Ivy Dale and Ivy Park Extension 22, Westenburg and surrounding areas. Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo says in a media release that, if all goes according to plan, water supply should be restored by Saturday morning, if not earlier. Mothapo also confirmed that temporary relief will be provided by water tankers moving through the areas and responding to specific requests from residents. Mothapo explained that the Devenish Street line was disconnected in June to allow for construction of a new non asbestos line as part of the old infrastructure replacement project. Water was in the interim supplied through a bypass pipe that is smaller in diameter. The municipality apologises for any inconvenience caused during this period. Residents that are not affected are urged to continue using water sparingly. Water related issues can be reported at 015 290 2629 or 105 290 2376, Mothapo said.
